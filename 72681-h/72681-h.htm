CHAPTER XXI.
<br><br>
THE ELOPEMENT DELAYED.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds<br>
  Towards Phœbus' mansion; such a waggoner<br>
  As phaeton would whip you to the west.<br>
  Come, gentle night; come, loving black browed night<br>
  Give me my Romeo.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Captain Heath and the postilion were not
the only persons impatient at the unexpected
delay.  Cecil leaning against a tree, watching
with anxious eyes the window of Blanche's
bed-room for the signal, and counting the
weary minutes, as they dragged with
immeasurable tediousness through their course of
sixty seconds, began at length to suppose that
she would never come.
</p>

<p>
Nor was the unhappy Blanche herself the
least impatient of the four.  The whole
mystery of the delay was the presence of Violet
in her room.  She had repeatedly announced
her intention of going to bed, but Violet gave
no signs of retiring, and their conversation
continued.
</p>

<p>
It more than once occurred to her to place
Violet in her confidence, but certain misgivings
restrained her.  The fact is, Blanche had been
uneasy at Cecil's attentions to Violet, during
the first period of their acquaintance with
him; an uneasiness which she now understood
to have been jealousy; and naturally felt
reluctant to speak of her engagement to one
who had almost been her sister's lover.
</p>

<p>
It happened that Cecil's name came up
during their conversation, and Violet turning
her large eyes upon her sister's face, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Shall I tell you my suspicion, Blanche?
Cecil Chamberlayne is fast falling in love with
you: you colour; you know it then? perhaps
return it?  Oh, for God's sake tell me that
you do not return it!"
</p>

<p>
"Why should I not?" replied Blanche,
greatly hurt.
</p>

<p>
"My poor Blanche!" said Violet, tenderly
kissing her, "I have hurt you, but it is with
a surgeon's knife, which inflicts pain to save
pain.  If it is not too late&mdash;if you are only at
the brink of the abyss, not in it&mdash;let me
implore you to draw back, and to examine your
situation calmly.  Oh! do not waste your
heart on such a man."
</p>

<p>
There was an earnestness in her manner
which only made her language more galling,
and Blanche somewhat pettishly replied,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You did not <i>always</i> think so.  At one
time you were near <i>wasting</i> your heart, as you
call it, upon him."
</p>

<p>
"I was," gravely replied Violet, "and a
fortunate accident opened my eyes in time.
You, who seemed to have watched me so
closely, may have noticed that for some time I
have ceased to encourage his attentions."
</p>

<p>
"Since he has ceased to pay them," retorted
Blanche.
</p>

<p>
Violet smiled a scornful smile.
</p>

<p>
Neither spoke for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
"I have a great mind to ascend the ladder,"
said the impatient Cecil to himself, and see if
it is only womanly weakness which detains
her."
</p>

<p>
"Can they have been detected?" Captain
Heath asked himself for the twentieth time.
</p>

<p>
"Blanche," said Violet at last, "you greatly
misunderstand me; but what is worse, you
greatly misunderstand <i>him</i>.  Listen!"
</p>

<p>
She then narrated the whole of her episode
with Cecil: her first yearnings towards
him&mdash;her interest, and almost love; then the
scene at the Grange; his conduct in the affair
with the bull; she recalled to Blanche the
mutual coldness which must have been observed
until after Cecil's confession respecting his
cowardice, which so far cleared him in her eyes,
that she was amiable to him for the rest of the
evening; she then told her of reflections made
that night when alone, and the result to which
she had arrived, and concluded by saying:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I am most willing to admit his fascinating
manners, his varied accomplishments, and some
good qualities; but he is weak, selfish, and
capricious.  He is not a proper husband for
you, the more so as he is poor, and has not the
character which will enable him to battle with
the world.  Rich, he would not make you a
good husband; poor, he will be a curse to
you, and throw the blame of his misery upon
you."
</p>

<p>
Blanche remained perfectly quiet during this
dissection of her lover's character, and not a
change in her countenance betrayed that it had
in the least affected her.  Nor had it.  Perfectly
incredulous, she listened to her sister,
seeing only the distortion of prejudice in her
language.
</p>

<p>
"Have you finished, Violet?" she quietly
asked.
</p>

<p>
"I have."
</p>

<p>
"Then give me a night to consider."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, consider it calmly; think of the man
on whom you are about to bestow your affections,
and ask yourself seriously, Is he the
man I ought to choose?&mdash;&mdash;  Good-night,
Blanche!"
</p>

<p>
"Good-night.  God bless you!" said
Blanche, hugging her fervently, which Violet
attributed to the emotion excited by their
conversation, but which really was the embrace of
parting.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes afterwards, Blanche was
descending the ladder, a small packet in her
hand, and was received in the arms of her
impatient lover.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br><br>
HOW THEY WENT TO LONDON.
</h3>

<p>
How the old post-chaise rattled merrily along
the hard road, as if conscious of the precious
burden which it bore!  There was no moon:
the sky was overcast.  Lights glimmered from
the windows of distant houses at rare intervals;
and the watch-dog's lonely bark was occasionally
heard&mdash;a sort of mournful sound, which told
how deep the night had gone.
</p>

<p>
With what wild passion&mdash;with what
inextinguishable delight the lovers pressed close to
each other, in that rumbling chaise!  The
sense of peril and of escape was mixed with
the indescribable rapture of two beings
conscious that all barriers are borne down, and
that they at length belong to each other.
</p>

<p>
Away! away! from home, with its restraints,
its perils, and its doubts&mdash;far into the wide
world of love and hope!&mdash;from father, sisters,
friends&mdash;from luxuries and comforts, cheaply
held by those who know not the reverse&mdash;to
the protecting bosom of a husband, dearer than
all the world beside; and with him to begin
the battle of life, which love will make an
everlasting triumph!
</p>

<p>
Away goes the rumbling chaise! too slowly
for its inmates, whose impatience needs
wings; too swiftly for the wretched man, who
sits behind, communing with his own bitter
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
What a slight partition divided the delirious
lovers from the unhappy wretch who rode behind
them&mdash;a partition which divided the joys
of paradise from the pangs of purgatory.  The
captain had not only to endure the misery of
unhappy love, but also the, to him, horrible
torture of believing the girl he loved had given
herself up to a villain, who did not intend to
marry her.
</p>

<p>
"If I <i>do</i> force him to marry her," he said,
"what happiness can she expect from such a
scoundrel?  Her character will be saved; but
her heart will be broken ...  If he refuses
... if I shoot him ... she will hate me ... will
not less revere his memory ... and will have
lost her name!"
</p>

<p>
And merrily the chaise rattled on.
</p>

<p>
It reached London at last.  There the
captain got down, and, hailing a cab, bade the
driver follow the post-chaise, at a slight
distance.  It stopped at an hotel.  They alighted,
and went in.
</p>

<p>
The captain followed them to the hotel.
His first act was to write this letter to
Meredith Vyner.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
(<i>Don't read this aloud.</i>)
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"My DEAR VYNER,
</p>

<p>
"Before this reaches you, the flight
of your daughter with Chamberlayne will have
been known to you.  Make yourself as easy as
possible under the deplorable calamity; for I
am in the same hotel with them, and will see
them duly married.
</p>

<p>
"You will be astonished to hear me talk of
their marriage, and of my forwarding it,
instead of taking every step to prevent it.  But,
when I tell you that marriage is now <i>imperative</i>&mdash;that
it is, alas! what we must all now eagerly
desire&mdash;my conduct will be intelligible.  Put
your perfect trust in me.  You know my
affection for your children, and my regard for the
honour of the family."
</p>

<p>
Great, indeed, was the consternation at the
Hall, on the morning when the flight was
discovered.  At first it was imagined Blanche
had gone off with Captain Heath; but when
Cecil's absence was also discovered, the real
state of the case was acknowledged.  But the
captain's absence still remained a mystery.
That he should be implicated in the elopement,
seemed impossible.  His known dislike
to Cecil, and his great regard for the whole
family, contradicted such a suspicion.  Yet
wherefore was he not forthcoming?
</p>

<p>
This threw such a mystery over the whole
affair, they knew not what conclusion to form;
some doubts began to arise as to whether it
really was an elopement.  Such matters were
not usually managed by three persons.  And
yet the moonlight ramble by the three on the
preceding evening did not that look as if there
were some understanding between them?
</p>

<p>
To this Rose objected, that as they had
been willing to accept of her company, it was
evident there could have been nothing in it
beyond a mere ramble.
</p>

<p>
It was observable that the one who
suggested and most warmly maintained the
probability of there being no elopement in the
case, but only perhaps some bit of fun, was
Mrs. Meredith Vyner, who absolutely
dissuaded her husband from taking any steps
towards pursuing the fugitives by this
reasoning:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Either they have eloped, or they are
executing some joke.  I incline to the latter;
but even admitting the former, you know
dear,&mdash;it is perfectly useless your following
them, until you know what route they
have taken, and as yet we have got no clue
whatever.  While you are hurrying to Gretna,
they may be quietly housed in London, and
so you have all the bother and agitation for
nothing."
</p>

<p>
Like all indolent men, Vyner was glad to
have an excuse for sitting still and doing
nothing.  But what was Mrs. Vyner's motive
for dissuading him?  Simply this: she believed
in the elopement, and was delighted at it.
Not only was there one daughter "off her
hands"&mdash;one rival the less&mdash;but by the act of
setting her father's consent at defiance, gave
him the power of refusing to give any dowry,
or even a trousseau, with something like an
excuse for so doing.  Mrs. Vyner had already
run her husband too deeply into debt, not to
keep a sharp eye on any means of economy
that did not affect her comforts or caprices;
and money spent upon "her dear girls," was
always considered worse than lost.
</p>

<p>
On the arrival of Captain Heath's letter, all
the mystery was revealed; and great was the
talk it occasioned!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br><br>
CECIL'S JEALOUSY.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
A husband's jealousy, which cunning men would pass upon
their wives for a compliment, is the worst can be made them;
for indeed it is a compliment to their beauty, but an affront to
their honour.
<p>

<p class="intro">
WYCHERLEY: <i>The Gentleman Dancing Master.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The captain had just sealed his letter when he
saw Cecil leave the hotel alone.  He determined
to profit by the opportunity, and seek
Blanche.  He found her writing.
</p>

<p>
As she recognised him, she gave a low
scream, and then springing up, exclaimed:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Is my father with you?  Oh! intercede
for us.  Gain his consent."
</p>

<p>
"I am alone, Blanche."
</p>

<p>
"Alone?"
</p>

<p>
"I came with you from Wytton.  The same
carriage brought us both; you rode inside, and
I behind."
</p>

<p>
"What! .... is .... what! are you
going to....?"
</p>

<p>
"To watch over you, dear Blanche, as a
brother would.  To <i>force</i> him to marry you."
</p>

<p>
"Force! why, what do you mean?  Cecil is
but this instant gone for the license."
</p>

<p>
"Are you <i>sure</i> of that?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure?  <i>He</i> said so; and shall I doubt his
word?"
</p>

<p>
"Why then did he bring you here?  Why
did he not take you to Gretna?"
</p>

<p>
"Because he feared we might be pursued,
and they would be sure to follow that route."
</p>

<p>
"Hm!  Yes, it is possible.  And <i>till</i> you
are married?"
</p>

<p>
"I am to stay with an old lady&mdash;a relation
of his.  He will prepare her to receive me this
morning."
</p>

<p>
He sighed.  So strange is human nature,
that the idea of Cecil behaving delicately and
honourably in the transaction, was at first a
disappointment and an additional grief to him!
He could not bear to think his rival less
contemptible than he had held him to be, nor
could he with pleasure find that his own
services were not needed.  Blanche wanted no
protector.  Nevertheless, partly out of a
lingering suspicion that all would not go on so
smoothly as it promised, and partly from the
very want he felt to consider himself of some
use to his beloved Blanche, he refused entirely
to credit her statement of Cecil's intentions,
and declared that he would remain to watch.
</p>

<p>
"At any rate, allow me to give you away,"
he said, "I shall then be sure that all is right.
Can you refuse me?"
</p>

<p>
She held out her hand to him by way of
answer.  He raised it respectfully to his lips,
gazed sorrowfully at her, and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
When Cecil returned, and learned from her
that the captain was in the same hotel, that he
had seen Blanche, and that she had consented
to his giving her away, he stormed with rage.
</p>

<p>
"Heath again!  Is the viper always to be in
my path, and imagine I shall not crush him at
last?  What is the meaning of his thrusting
himself between us?" he asked her, with great
fierceness.  "What the devil is at the bottom
of it?  What makes him so anxious to have
you married?  I am a beggar, and he knows
it; yet first one thing, then the other, he has
nothing but schemes to make me marry you.
Wanted me to be a quill-driver, that I might
be rich enough to marry.  Marry, marry,
marry!  By God! there is something in it
which I will discover."
</p>

<p>
"Cecil, dearest Cecil, you terrify me!"
</p>

<p>
He paced angrily up and down the room,
without attending to her.  A horrible suspicion
had taken possession of his mind: he thought
that Captain Heath had not only been her
lover, but that his passion had been returned,
and that it was to conceal the consequences of
their guilty love that a marriage with any one
seemed so desirable.
</p>

<p>
"I see it all," he said to himself, as he strode
about the room; "they have selected me as
their gull.  It is a collusion.  From whom, but
from her, should he have known we had taken
that moonlight stroll in the shrubbery?  Why
should he take upon himself the office of
sentinel?  Why offer me a situation?  Why
follow us up to town?  How should he know
we were to elope?  Why should he, in God's
name, be anxious to have her married, when
it is quite clear he loves her, or has loved her,
himself?  He owned it last night&mdash;owned that
he loved her!  I do believe, when he carried
off the ladder, he knew I was in the room, and
adopted that mode of making me irretrievably
commit myself.&mdash;But it is not too late.&mdash;We
are not married yet!"
</p>

<p>
How curiously passion colours facts!  No
one will say that Cecil had not what is called
abundant "evidence" for his suspicion, and
the evidence was coherent enough to
justify to his own mind all that he thought.
It is constantly so in life.  We set out
with a presumption, and all the "facts" fit in
so well with the presumption, that we forget
it is after all not the <i>facts</i>, but the
<i>interpretation</i> which is the important thing we seek
and instead of seeking this we have begun by
assuming it; whereas had we assumed some
other interpretation, we should perhaps have
found the facts quite as significant, although
the second interpretation would be diametrically
opposed to the former.
</p>

<p>
Had Cecil, instead of seeking for corroborative
facts to pamper his own irritable jealousy,
just asked himself whether the characters
of Blanche and the captain were not quite
sufficient of themselves to throw discredit on
any suspicion of the kind&mdash;whether, indeed,
he ought to entertain such an idea of such
persons, unless overwhelmed by the most
clear, precise, unequivocal evidence&mdash;he would
have saved himself all the tortures of jealousy,
and would not have desecrated the worship
of his love by thoughts so debasing and so
odious.
</p>

<p>
Blanche, perfectly bewildered, sat silent
and trembling, keeping her eyes fixed upon
the strangely altered bearing of her lover.
</p>

<p>
Stopping from his agitated walk, he suddenly
stood still, folded his arms, gazed at her
with quiet fierceness, and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"As Captain Heath takes so much interest
in, you, perhaps he will have no objection to
escort you back to your father."
</p>

<p>
"Cecil! ... Cecil! ... In Heaven's name,
what do you mean?" she said, half rising from
her chair; but afraid to trust her trembling
limbs, she sank back again, and looked at him
in helpless astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"My meaning is very plain, very," he
said, with intense coldness.  "You are free
to return to your family, or not to return, if
you prefer remaining with Captain Heath.
Perhaps," he added sarcastically, "as he is
so partial to marriage, he will marry you
himself."
</p>

<p>
She strove to speak, but a choking
sensation at the throat prevented her.  She saw
him leave the room without having strength
to recall him, without ever making a motion
to prevent him.
</p>

<p>
In mute despair, she heard his heavy tread
upon the stairs, and like a person stunned,
felt no command of her faculties, scarcely
felt anything beyond a stupid bewildering
prostration of the soul.
</p>

<p>
With flushed face and heated brain, Cecil
rushed into the street, and wandered
distractedly away.  The fresh air somewhat
cooled his burning brow, and the exercise
gradually enabled him to recover his
self-possession.  He began to doubt whether he
had not been rash in his suspicions.
</p>

<p>
"It is quite true that Heath has taken
a most extraordinary part in the whole affair;
but I remember now, that, during our
interview in my room, he seemed by no means
anxious I should marry her; indeed I taunted
him with wishing to get me out of the way.
He offered me the secretaryship to enable me
to marry, and when I refused that he set his
face against ... I have been an ass! ...
</p>

<p>
"And yet his conduct is inexplicable.  He
loves her, and she knows it....  What a
web entangles me! ... I will return and
question her; she cannot deceive me ... she
is not altogether lost ... I will try her."
</p>

<p>
With this purpose he returned.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Captain Heath had found
Blanche weeping bitterly, under the degrading
accusation of Cecil's jealousy; and having
extorted from her some incoherent sentences,
which made him aware of what had
passed, he said, "My dear Blanche, I am
going to bid you have courage for an act of
fortitude.  You must struggle with yourself&mdash;you
must reason calmly for a moment."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, tell me, tell me what to do.  How
shall I eradicate his suspicions?"
</p>

<p>
"You cannot do it.  In one so weak and
capricious&mdash;one who could think so unworthily
of you, and upon such ridiculous appearances&mdash;jealousy
is incurable.  It will bring endless
misery upon you.  It will destroy all love, all
confidence.  If he suspects you already, what
is to secure you from his suspicions hereafter?
Blanche, you must quit this.  Return with
me to your father's; he will receive you
kindly."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no," sobbed the unhappy girl.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Blanche.  It is a hard alternative,
but it is the best.  You ought to rejoice in his
injustice, because it displays him in his true
colours.  He tells you what you have to expect."
</p>

<p>
"I love him."
</p>

<p>
"Alas!  I know it; but you see how he
repays your love."
</p>

<p>
She only sobbed in answer.
</p>

<p>
"He will make you miserable for ever.
Now, before the irrevocable step is taken, release
yourself from such a fate: return with me."
</p>

<p>
She wept, but could not speak.
</p>

<p>
Heath's arguments at last prevailed; and,
in a tone of terrible despair, she exclaimed,
"Take me home, then."
</p>

<p>
A flash of joy passed over his sad face as
he heard this heart-broken phrase, which
assured him that, however his beloved Blanche
might suffer at first, she was at least saved
from the certain misery of becoming the wife
of Cecil Chamberlayne.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the hotel, Cecil ran rapidly up
stairs, and on the first landing stood aghast, at
seeing Blanche coming down, leaning on the
captain's arm.  She was weeping, and her
face was hidden by the handkerchief with
which she wiped her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you taking her?" Cecil fiercely
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Home," was the stern reply.
</p>

<p>
"Home!  Whose home? yours?"
</p>

<p>
"To her father."
</p>

<p>
"And by whose authority?" he said, in a
low, hoarse, almost suffocated voice.
</p>

<p>
"Her own," was the crushing answer.
</p>

<p>
They passed on.
</p>

<p>
Cecil, amazed, bewildered, could merely
utter, in a tone of sad and reproachful inquiry,
"Blanche!"
</p>

<p>
A stifled, agonizing sob burst from her; but
clinging closer to her protector, she hurried
him on.
</p>

<p>
Cecil leaned against the banister for support.
As Blanche reached the bottom of the
stairs, she could not resist giving a parting
look; and the anguish of the face which then
met her eye so completely changed her feelings,
that, forgetting all Captain Heath had
said, she flew up the stairs and threw herself
into Cecil's arms, exclaiming, "My own
beloved, you will not send me from you?"
</p>

<p>
He pressed her frantically to his heart, and
carried her back to their apartment.
</p>

<p>
Captain Heath's face was contracted by a
fearful spasm as he slowly sought his own
room.  Once more were his hopes crushed;
once more had he to renounce the visions of
exquisite bliss which filled his soul.  On the
point of for ever separating Blanche from her
unworthy lover, as he had imagined, and with
the opening which that separation made for
his own future prospects, he now again saw
that the struggle was useless, and that Blanche
was irretrievably lost to him.

CHAPTER XXIV.
<br><br>
THE DENOUEMENT.
</h3>

<p>
Four days afterwards, Meredith Vyner received
this letter:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"They are married at last; and are now
gone to Broadstairs for the honeymoon.  It
is a sad affair; but it was inevitable.  May she
be happy!
</p>

<p>
"I was to have given her away; but, from
some caprice on his part, it was not permitted;
and the office was performed by one of his club
friends, a certain Mr. Forrester.  I was present,
however; though not invited.  From one of
the side pews, I witnessed the ceremony.  The
last words of dear Blanche were, that I should
intercede for her with you; which, God knows,
I would, did I think that a father's heart needed
the intercession!  But your kind nature is quite
assurance enough to me.
</p>

<p>
"I am forced to go to Italy, to join my
brother; and, as I have no time to lose, Mrs. Vyner
will, I dare say, excuse my taking formal
leave.  Pray, let my trunks be packed, and
forwarded to me, at Southampton, where I shall
be to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
"You shall hear further from me soon; now
I am too busy to write more."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the calm tone of this letter there is the
same stoicism which always enabled this brave
man if not to conquer, at least to conceal
his emotions.  Who could have suspected the
misery which really lay concealed in those few
lines?
</p>

<p>
The adroitness with which he recommended
Blanche to her father's generosity, showed how
affection will sharpen the wits, and make even
the most candid people cunning, to attain their
ends.  He knew that Mrs. Vyner had too much
need of money, not to grudge any bestowed
upon the girls; and that Vyner himself was
little likely to suffer his regard for his child,
such as it was, to withstand his wife's persuasion.
Therefore, to have pleaded in Blanche's
favour, would have been to call down certain
defeat.  Instead of that, he adroitly assumed
that Vyner could not need any intercession&mdash;could
not, as a father, do otherwise than
pardon his daughter.  To refuse the pardon,
would therefore be to act contrary to all
expectation.  The question was thus not discussed,
but settled.
</p>

<p>
The second point in his letter is, the journey
to Italy: that needs only a very brief comment:
he hoped, in the confusion of foreign scenes, to
distract his thoughts from grief.
</p>

<p>
Farewell, then, thou brave, honest,
self-sacrificing man!  May travel bring oblivion! may
time bring consolation to thy sad and
noble heart!

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
ROSE VYNER TO FANNY WORSLEY.
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
WYTTON HALL, 14<i>th Oct.</i> 1840.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
MY DEAR FANNY,
</p>

<p>
Since poor Blanche's unfortunate marriage&mdash;and
yet why should I call it unfortunate? has
she not married the man of her choice, and is
not that the great ideal we maidens all aspire
to?  However, as it is the fashion here to
speak of it as a "most unfortunate business,"
over which mama weeps (I don't clearly see
why) and papa storms, I have caught the trick,
and called it so to you.
</p>

<p>
To resume this broken sentence; or rather
to begin it anew: since Blanche's fortunate
marriage, our days have passed equably
enough; but although not characterized by
any "incidents," nor affording any "news,"
they have not been stupid.  Life has not been
stagnant.  The slow growth of passions has
proceeded without interruption.  Marmaduke
Ashley has become the devoted slave of
Violet.  I call him her Brazilian Othello.  I
made her very angry yesterday, by telling her
that she should be less cruelly haughty to
him, "for is he not," said I, "<i>a man and a
brother</i>?"  They would make a superb couple,
for although I tease her with references to
gentlemen of colour, and with congratulatory
remarks respecting the chain being "broken,
and Africa being free," you must know that
his complexion is not really darker than that
of a Spaniard.  And you know how lovely she
is&mdash;no you don't, you have not seen her since
she shook off girlish things, and cannot
imagine how she has altered.
</p>

<p>
Poor Marmaduke, although he has made
some impression on her, will have, I fear, to
languish a long while ere the haughty beauty
condescends to step down from her pedestal.
Almost as long as I shall have to wait before
the modest Julius will understand, without my
being forced to tell him, that he is not
absolutely indifferent to a certain saucy girl at
whom he makes sweet eyes.
</p>

<p>
You can't imagine how, every day, my
admiration deepens for the little man.  I am
always finding some new illustration of his
excellence; always hearing something which
confirms my opinion of his nobility of soul.
Yesterday, I found that he was studying
hard for the bar, not because he was without
fortune, but because he would not consent to
his mother being poorer at the death of his
father than she had been before.  He was the
heir to all the property, except a jointure; but
he refused to enter into possession while his
mother lived, and as every man ought, he
says, to be able to gain his own livelihood,
he has determined to gain his at the bar.
</p>

<p>
He has recently been exerting himself to
procure a good subscription list to a volume of
poems.  Here is the title.  "GLOOMS AND
GLEAMS.  By One who has suffered."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am as a weed<br>
  Torn from the rock, on ocean's foam to sail,<br>
  Where'er the wave or tempest's breath prevail.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BYRON.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
The mysterious one&mdash;the one who has suffered
(<i>what</i> not specified!) is a newly discovered
wonder&mdash;the Sappho of Walton&mdash;the daughter
of a linen-draper.
</p>

<p>
According to Julius she is really a clever
deserving girl, a little wild in her notions, but
with all the generosity of genius, which
redeems her affectations and her follies.  She is
too poor to venture on publication herself;
and I have just found that Julius, unable to
secure a sufficient sum by subscription, has
undertaken to pay the printing expenses.  He
stipulated that this should be a secret; but
her grateful father disclosed it to Mrs. Roberts
(our housekeeper) who disclosed it to me.
Imagine the gossip there will be in Walton
over this publication!  How the papas and
mamas, the uncles and maiden aunts will
moralize over the corruption of the age,
and the wild audacious vanity of their
townswoman!  A poetess in Walton?  Why a
volume of poems&mdash;(unless they were low
church effusions or the inspirations of
"advanced Christians"&mdash;) is itself a rarity.  You
know how slightly tainted with literature the
small towns of England usually are?  I doubt
if any are so colourless as Walton.  Dickens
penetrates here&mdash;where does not his genial
sunshine penetrate?&mdash;but no other name of
those blown from the brazenly impudent
trumpet of fame has ever found an echo in
Walton.  A poetess is, consequently, looked
upon as something short of a sorceress: a
fearful and Appalling Illustration of the
Reckless March of Intellect which Devastates the
World!
</p>

<p>
Julius has already secured her an influential
patron in Sir Chetsom Chetsom, and his brother
Tom Chetsom.  The baronet is possessor
of the Dingles, a fine estate within three
miles of Walton, and is looked up to as one
of the great people of the county.  Such a
figure as he is!  I must sketch him for your
amusement.
</p>

<p>
Sir Chetsom Chetsom is not without considerable
daring, for with the weight of six or
seven and sixty years upon his shoulders, he
makes a gallant dash at thirty.  His whiskers
are miraculously black, always well-oiled, and
stiffly curled; his eyebrows are of another
black in virtue of his inheritance from nature;
and his hair is of a third black in virtue of
Truefit's well directed efforts at <i>wigmanity</i>.
This threefold darkness, unsuspicious of a
gray hair, overshadows a sallow, wrinkled
brow and cheeks, upon which a hare's foot
imitates the ruddy glow of youth with a sort of
Vauxhall-by-daylight-splendour.  Under the
genuine eyebrows, float two colourless eyes,
between which a high and well-shaped nose
rears its haughty form.  Frightfully regular
teeth, without a speck, without a gap, fill up
the gash which represents his mouth.  A
well-padded chest, and well-stayed waist,
ending in shrunken legs and excruciatingly
tight-booted feet complete the <i>physique</i> of this
Adonis.  His dress is a perpetual book of
fashions!
</p>

<p>
Of the <i>morale</i> I know little, except that he
never plays cards&mdash;flatters himself he has not
come to that <i>yet</i>&mdash;talks fluently of valtzing
(particular about sounding the <i>w</i> as <i>v</i>, as a
young gentleman after his first German lesson),
adores Fanny Elssler, calls Grisi a <i>naice leetle
giarl enough</i>, thinks himself, and wishes to be
accepted as, a remorseless Lovelace, and is
always afraid of talking too long with one
woman, lest he should "compromise her."
</p>

<p>
This ferocious lady-killer, whom you will
at once place amongst that very terrific and
numerous class of men which I have christened
Murders, has a brother, whom I wonder
he does not disown, so frankly does that
brother bear his age.  Tom Chetsom, "jolly
Tom Chetsom," as he is called, is "a tun of a
man," with a bald, shiny pate fringed with
straggling grey hair, a rubicund face, a
vinous nose, and a moist, <i>oystery</i> eye, rolling
in rheum.  Yet this implacable exhibition of
age in a younger brother is tolerated by the
baronet, who is blind enough, or stupid
enough, not to be aware of the comment it
is on his own resplendent juvenility!
</p>

<p>
Tom Chetsom, careless <i>bon vivant</i> as he
seems, and is, conceals beneath that rubicund
jollity an astute selfishness, and a real
knowledge of life and human nature, to which his
elder brother makes great pretension.  But
that which the elder <i>seems</i> to be without being
it, the younger <i>is</i> without seeming it, as
Browning would say.
</p>

<p>
Well, these are the patrons selected for our
Walton Sappho.  They are to launch her into
the "great world."  Sir Chetsom has
permitted the dedication of <i>Glooms and Gleams</i>
to himself.  He is to introduce the volume
into the "first circles," while Tom Chetsom
is to bruit its fame in all the clubs.
</p>

<p>
I have not yet seen the poetess herself; but
propose to fall in with the general "rage,"
and pay a visit at the Grange some day
when she is there.  I will give you a full
description.
</p>

<p>
And there is an end of my budget.

CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
THE WOMAN WITH A MISSION.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  Ein starker Geist in einem zarten Leib<br>
  Ein zwitter zwischen Mann und Weib,<br>
  Gleich ungeschickt zum Herrschen und zum Lieben,<br>
  Ein kind mit eines Riesen Waffen<br>
  Ein Mittelding von Weisen und von Affen!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCHILLER.&mdash;<i>Die Berühmte Frau.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Marmaduke and Violet, "so justly formed to
meet by nature," have not, it may be supposed,
remained insensible to each other's charms.
The elopement of Blanche gave him several
opportunities of making eloquent remarks on
the superiority of affection&mdash;the riches of the
heart&mdash;to mere worldly wealth; and to utter
several stinging sarcasms on those who gave
up the worship of a loving heart, for the
trumpery advantages of an establishment and a
position.
</p>

<p>
These sarcasms were, of course, meant for
Mrs. Meredith Vyner, who accepted them in
bland silence, or made vague defences, saying
that women were often misguided, because the
whole of the facts were not known.
</p>

<p>
Violet so entirely responded to his
sentiments, and, without knowing the previous
connection between him and her mother, so
unhesitatingly applied those sarcasms to her, that
she became more and more attracted to him,
from the fact that they alone seemed rightly
to have read her mother's character.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Meredith Vyner saw, with strangely
mingled jealousy and pleasure, the growing
attachment of these two.  She did not love
Marmaduke: she had never loved him in any
high or generous sense of the term.  But he
had filled her girlish imagination, and he still
exercised a certain fascination over her.  She
admired his beauty; she delighted in the sense
of power exercised over so fiery and impetuous
a creature; it was exquisite flattery.  To see
her place occupied in his heart was, therefore,
singularly irritating.  His anger was an
avowal of his love.  His threats of vengeance,
much as she might dread them, were the
threats of one who suffered in his love.  And
so clearly did she perceive this, that it occasioned
no surprise to observe how, in the same measure
as his attachment grew to Violet, his anger
seemed to abate, his mind no longer to run
upon its old topics of inconstancy and
vengeance.  No surprise, but great jealousy!
</p>

<p>
Other feelings mingled with this.  She could
not but be delighted to think that Marmaduke
had ceased to harbour any schemes against
her peace: the tiger was pacified, or attracted
by other prey.  This was not all.  She hated
Violet, and watched the development of this
passion with curious eagerness, because in it
she foresaw two sources of misery to her
daughter.  If they married, she thought they
would be mutually wretched, and it was in her
power at any time to make Violet horribly
jealous, by informing her of Marmaduke's early
attachment.  That was one source; another
was, with a little coquetry and cunning on her
part, to bring him once more at her feet,
which, she doubted not, she could still effect.
</p>

<p>
Under the "still life" of what seemed the
most uneventful of country residences, under
the smooth current of every-day occupations,
such were the tempests rumbling in the deeps,
and ready at an instant to burst forth!  The
drama was really there; it seemed to be
elsewhere.  The development and collision of
passions, out of which the dramas of life are
constructed, were circumscribed within the
walls of the Hall and the Grange.  But it was
elsewhere that the noisy bustle of event&mdash;noisy
because of its emptiness&mdash;attracted the
attention of spectators, and seemed, by the talk
occasioned, to have absorbed all the interest
which could possibly lie in the elements afforded
by the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
But, first, a word respecting one of the
principal actors.  I mean Hester Mason, the
poetess.  Had Rose's letter, in which, according
to promise, she doubtless gave a detailed
description of the Walton Sappho fallen into
my hands, you should have been treated with
her lively account of this important personage:
her womanly acuteness and observation would
have assuredly delighted you.  As it is, my
matter-of-fact pen must be the substitute.
</p>

<p>
Hester Mason was five and twenty, and still
wrote Miss before her name; not because
adorers were backward, but because they were
Waltonians.  They had no "spirituality;"
they had no "imaginings;" they had no
"mission."  Life to them had no "earnestness;"
they lived without a "purpose."  Cowards,
they humbled themselves before
"conventionalities," and dared not tell society
to its face that it was a lie.  They went to
church; they called themselves Christians,
because they followed an antiquated routine,
and did not comprehend the later "developements"
of Christianity necessitated by the
"wants of the age."  Above all, they shuddered
at the true doctrine of social regeneration,
that, namely, of the emancipation of
woman, and thought that marriage should be
indissoluble.  They were humdrums!
</p>

<p>
Not to one of those could she descend; her
soul was too lofty, her passions too "devouring,"
to waste themselves on such "clods."  Indeed,
had she been less of a "priestess," she
might have been equally exclusive; since the
Waltonians were utterly without taste for
literature, philosophy, or art; and were as
ill looking as the inhabitants of small towns
usually are.  Hester had been thrice on a
visit of a few days to London; she had seen
Hyde Park and its brilliant company; she
had walked down St. James's-street and Pall
Mall, and on the doorsteps of the clubs had
seen men who were gods compared with the
dandies of Walton.  She had feasted upon
contemporary literature, and had written
burning letters of wild enthusiasm to Bulwer,
in imitation of his "Florence Lascelles."  She
had dreamed ambitious dreams, in which she
held a sceptre in London society, and awoke
to find herself in Walton!
</p>

<p>
Hester was handsome, but coarse-featured.
Her black hair and eyes gave a certain <i>éclat</i>
to a face ornamented with a nose which
irredeemably betrayed her low birth, and
surmounted by a forehead too high and large for
beauty.  She was about the middle height,
and had a magnificent bust.  Her hands were
large and coarse; her legs were&mdash;to express
them in one word, I should say they were
<i>Devonshire legs</i>!  In her dress, gait, and
manner you saw something which, though not
positively vulgar, was distinctly not ladylike;
a certain <i>brusquerie</i>, almost pertness, and a
dogmatism, which is at all times shocking in a
woman.
</p>

<p>
About the time when Julius St. John first
interested himself in the publication of her
volume of poems, Hester, worn out with
awaiting her "ideal," and almost despairing
of ever reigning in London society, began so
far to humble herself in her own eyes, as to
admit the attentions of the surgeon's
apprentice, newly arrived at Walton.  True it is
that James Stone, the foresaid apprentice, had
a dash of London about him.  He was not a
Waltonian, he was not a humdrum; so far
from it, that he had the character of a
"rake!"  He discoursed about the ballet;
had been behind the scenes at the theatres;
was well-versed in Jullien's promenade
concerts (then a novelty); smoked a meerschaum;
and when in full-dress turned his shirt-sleeve
cuffs over his coat, much to the amazement of
the Waltonians, who imagined he had just
washed his hands, and had forgotten to turn
back his cuffs, so little did they appreciate the
dandyism!
</p>

<p>
It may appear strange, but that little trait of
elegance won more of Hester's admiration than
all his personal charms, and they were not few,
could have effected in a month.  It gave him
a London air.  It made him so superior to the
provincial bumpkins, who laughed with coarse
ridicule at an elegance they could not
understand.  It was in vain Hester, bridling, told
them that the "pink of fashion and the mould
of form"&mdash;the all-accomplished Count D'Orsay&mdash;wore
his cuffs in that way.  They only
laughed the more, and christened Stone&mdash;the
Walton <i>De</i> Orsay.
</p>

<p>
As long as Stone held out against the
ridicule which his innovation excited, Hester
accorded him her sympathy, and almost her
love.  But when he yielded to public opinion,
and turned back his cuffs to their original
place, she suddenly cooled towards him.  It
was a submission to conventionalities.  It was
a truckling to society.  It was cowardice.
</p>

<p>
He purchased his pardon, however, and by
a speech so adroit that in Walton it must have
appeared worthy at least of a Lauzun&mdash;had
Lauzun's name ever been heard there.
</p>

<p>
"If I do not yield this trifle to public
opinion they will force me to quit this place,
and to quit the place would be quitting <i>you</i>."&mdash;She
forgave him.
</p>

<p>
But her pardon availed him little.  Invited
by Mrs. St. John to the Grange, patronized
by the "great people" round Walton, her
volume on the eve of being launched into the
wide sea of literature, she felt all her old
ambition revive within her, and scarcely
forgave herself for having idled away an hour
with such a youth as Stone&mdash;too poor for a
husband, too insignificant for a lover.
</p>

<p>
The patronage of Sir Chetsom Chetsom
completed her intoxication.  That graceless
old Lovelace, struck with the beauty of his
protégé, saw at once the facilities afforded him
for an intrigue.  He was constantly at her
father's.  Her poems made the pretext of his
visits.  Her charms formed the staple of his
conversation; varied by accounts of London
society, and visions of the brilliant career which
awaited her if she only determined boldly to
enter it.
</p>

<p>
A sorry figure, truly, was the wigged and
whiskered baronet for a girl with "bright
imaginings," and at five and twenty, to choose
as her lover; and yet, if I have contrived to
indicate her character properly, the reader will
not be surprised at her lending a willing ear to
the old boy's artful flatteries.
</p>

<p>
He was not young, but he was rich.  He
had no "imaginings," but he could tell of the
splendours of the capital.  He had no
"mission," but he wore <i>bottes vernies</i>.  He was
without "earnestness," but he talked fluently
of all the new works, and had met most of the
literary lions in society.
</p>

<p>
More than all, he was Sir Chetsom Chetsom,
and she was Hester Mason the
linen-draper's daughter.  Rank gives a lustre which
dazzles even virtue; and Hester had very
few scruples of virtue to struggle against; so
that ambition found her an easy victim.  She
coquetted&mdash;she was "cruel" to her adorer;
not because she was afraid to yield, but
because she wished to sell her honour dearly.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
WHAT WAS SAID OF THE WALTON SAPPHO.
</h3>

<p>
"Is it not shocking?" said Mrs. Ruddles, the
curate's wife, to Mrs. Spedley, the surgeon's
better half, as she sipped the smoking bohea,
and commented on the ongoings of Walton,
and its "muse" in particular,&mdash;"Is it not
shocking to witness such depravity?  To think
of his taking up with such trumpery as Hester
Mason!"
</p>

<p>
"And to think of her encouraging the
wicked, old villain!" ejaculated the indignant
Mrs. Spedley.
</p>

<p>
"And her father to shut his eyes!"
suggested the post-mistress of Walton.
</p>

<p>
"What can she expect will be the end of it?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure, I can't say."
</p>

<p>
"He's married, too," said Stone, angrily;
for Stone was now utterly neglected: he had
even turned up his shirt cuffs, with D'Orsay
magnificence, on the preceding Sunday; and
still Hester had not vouchsafed him a look.
</p>

<p>
"Married! yes; but he could get nobody
to live with him; and his wife has been
separated many years," observed Mrs. Ruddles;
"and no wonder!"
</p>

<p>
"So that Hester falls with her eyes open
... she can't expect him to marry her&mdash;the
minx!" said Mrs. Spedley.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no.  Besides, she looks upon marriage
as immoral."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes: very comfortable notions those are
for some people."
</p>

<p>
"Very.  <i>This</i> comes of writing poetry!"
gravely and philosophically remarked the
surgeon's wife.
</p>

<p>
Her husband entered at that moment.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty poetry it is!" he said.  "Hang me,
if I can make head or tail of it.  Long words
and inflated sentiments&mdash;nothing else!"
</p>

<p>
"Such trash!" scornfully added Mrs. Ruddles.
</p>

<p>
"So frivolous!" chimed in Mrs. Spedley.
</p>

<p>
"As if there was anything in that, to
cock up one's head about," pursued Mrs. Ruddles.
</p>

<p>
"And, to fancy herself so superior to every
one else."
</p>

<p>
"Well, give me good, common sense in a
woman," fervently ejaculated Spedley.
</p>

<p>
"And me."
</p>

<p>
"And me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, and me."
</p>

<p>
"It was but last night," said Spedley,
"that she took upon herself to set me right
about the vote by ballot; and, instead of
arguing the point, she told me that I was
incapable of forming an opinion on it, ignorant
as I was of the <i>rapid developments of humanity</i>.
To be sure, I was,&mdash;how should I know what
she meant by that?"
</p>

<p>
"He&mdash;he&mdash;he!" tittered Mrs. Spedley.&mdash;"Developments
of humanity, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"That is a philosophy <i>she</i> understands," said
Stone, sarcastically; "and will certainly give us
an <i>illustration</i> of it <i>herself</i> shortly&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Stone chuckled immensely at this <i>double
entendre</i>; and the ladies, forgetting their prudery
in their spite, laughed too, and declared that
nothing was more likely.
</p>

<p>
That is only a sample of what was said in
Walton.  The whole town was busy with the
event.  Envy aided tittle-tattle; and not a
voice was raised in Hester's defence.  Sir
Chetsom to visit her!  Sir Chetsom to drive
up to her door!  Sir Chetsom to send her
game!  Sir Chetsom to take her drives in
his curricle.  It was enough to make an English
community, like that of Walton, mad.  How
she escaped lapidation is a mystery.
</p>

<p>
Hester knew the scandal she occasioned, and
triumphed in it.  To be the mark for jealousy,
was a condition affixed to superiority.  Detraction
was the tribute impotence paid to power.
She was hated&mdash;she knew it&mdash;how could it be
otherwise?&mdash;was she not a genius?  At their
gossip she laughed; with society and its <i>sophisms</i>
she was at open war.
</p>

<p>
Having had this one glimpse of the state of
opinion in Walton, let us now turn our
attention to the Hall.  The St. Johns, Marmaduke,
Tom Wincot, and the family, are in the drawing
room.  Julius holds the volume of Hester's
poems in his hands, having just finished reading
it aloud:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr. Vyner," said Julius, "do you
rescind your harsh judgment; will you not
admit that there is at least great facility in
these poems?"
</p>

<p>
"Facility?" replied Vyner.  "Yes, yes,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Nempe incomposito dixi pede currere versus.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I find too much of it: fatal facility, betraying
the want of that <i>labor limæ</i>, without which no
work can have value."
</p>

<p>
"She will learn the difficult 'art to blot' in
time," suggested Julius; "at present she is all
exuberance."
</p>

<p>
"Is not over luxuriance," said Violet, "rather
the property of weeds than of flowers?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said Vyner.  "The volume wants
weeding sadly.  You know what 'Horace'
says?&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ut brevitate opus, ut currat sententia, neu se<br>
  Impediat verbis lassas onerantibus aures."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Well," interrupted Rose; "but not to be
so critical, do you not think the volume shows
great power?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather the <i>will</i> to be great than the <i>power</i>,"
said Marmaduke.  "It is daring and extravagant,
but it does not seem to me to have the
daring and extravagance of genius."
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't it stwike you as vewy stwange
that a young woman should wite in such
twemendous misewy?  Nothing but
seductions, delusions, bwoken hearts, pwostwated
spiwits, agonies of wemorse, tewible pwedictions,
wetched wevewies, and all that sort of
thing!  Besides, what does she pwopose when
she wepeatedly weitewates the necessity of
some better and more weflective Chwistianity?"
</p>

<p>
"Those are the extravagances I speak of."
</p>

<p>
"I confess," said Violet, "I do not like the
tricks she plays with language: surely all
those uncouth compounds, and those obtrusive
vowels which everybody else consents to drop,
are useless affectations?"
</p>

<p>
"Those are the conquests of the New
School," said Marmaduke.
</p>

<p>
"I thought that our great poets had found
the language harmonious and flexible enough."
</p>

<p>
"You see, Mr. St. John," said Rose, laughing,
"they are determined to pull your poetess
to pieces.  Don't hear any more.  I will admire
her with you, and we shall form the fit
audience, though few."
</p>

<p>
The conversation did not cease here; but we
have heard enough.  Let us hurry, therefore,
to Belgravia, where resides Sir Chetsom Chetsom,
who has been forced to run up to town for
a few days, and is now seated opposite his
brother, his hand upon the claret decanter,
listening to a brotherly remonstrance.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, Chet, she is <i>une intriguante</i>:
underneath all that romance and extravagance, I
see a very cool calculation.  In the letter you
have just read me, I divine her character."
</p>

<p>
"What is there in that to make you suspicious?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! no single passage, but the whole tone.
Do but consider for a moment.  Here are you,
a married man, writing love-letters to an
unmarried girl; she does not repulse you&mdash;she
does not even <i>pretend</i> to be offended&mdash;she says
nothing about your wife, nothing about the
unmistakeable nature of your intentions."
</p>

<p>
"But I tell you, Tom, the giarl is decidedly
fond of me."
</p>

<p>
"Humph."
</p>

<p>
"You doubt it?"
</p>

<p>
"Considerably."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, very well.  I, who see her,
who watch her, and who flatter myself know
<i>something</i> of women&mdash;<i>I</i> think so, and that is
enough."
</p>

<p>
"Do you ever look in the glass, Chet?"
</p>

<p>
"Often."
</p>

<p>
"And the result is?"
</p>

<p>
"Very different from what must occur in
your case, Tom, if ever you venture on such a
piece of temerity."
</p>

<p>
"And you think yourself still capable of
inspiring a passion?"
</p>

<p>
"The thing is done."
</p>

<p>
"And <i>you</i> are done, Chet," said Tom
Chetsom, placing one bulbous finger at the
side of his vinous nose, and closing one oystery
eye, by way of pantomimic comment on his
words.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know women, Tom."
</p>

<p>
"Well, let us grant for a moment that you
have made an impression; don't you see the
imprudence of having an intrigue so near your
home, in a little place where every action is
noticed and discussed?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care a fig what they discuss.
That's the giarl's look out, not mine, damme!
If neither she nor her father object to my
visits, why should I be squeamish?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Because you will be the laughter
of the county."
</p>

<p>
"Thank ye, Tom."
</p>

<p>
"I'm serious, Chet.  Your age is tolerably
well known <i>there</i>, and you may imagine the
gossip and the ridicule which will attach to
any affair of yours with a young girl.  It will
be the talk of the whole county."
</p>

<p>
Sir Chetsom knew that quite as well as his
knowing brother; but what his brother did not
know, was that the great attraction in this
intrigue consisted in the very fact so distinctly
enunciated: "It will be the talk of the whole
county!"  He wished it to be so.  He anticipated
the scandal, and rejoiced thereat.  He
heard the chorus of virtuous matrons declaiming
against his "wickedness," and the sound
was exquisitely flattering.  He shook his head
with an air of knowing satisfaction as he read
(in his mind's eye) the paragraphs in the local
papers upbraiding him for his villainy.  The
phrase "The wretch! at <i>his</i> age to be
seducing women!" flattered his anticipative ear
more sweetly than any strain from Beethoven
or Mozart could lull the spirit of a musician.
</p>

<p>
Tom Chetsom, frank old fellow, never once
attempting to conceal a wrinkle, or to disguise
a bald patch, could not comprehend his brother's
secret pride in being made a butt.  He
understood the vanity of his brother's dandyism
and juvenility: he saw specimens enough of
that at his club.  But knowing how all men,
and above all men Sir Chetsom, shrunk from
ridicule, it was a puzzle to him that the inevitable
ridicule of his intrigue with Hester should
not be a bugbear to frighten him away.  He
forgot that amidst all the ridicule and
reprobation, there would be a tacit acknowledgment
of Sir Chetsom's lady-killing powers; and for
that acknowledgment he could scarcely pay too
dearly.
</p>

<p>
As a mere safeguard for his vanity, and not
out of any illiberality, he had from the first
determined upon making no settlement on
Hester, in case she should consent to live with
him.  If his intrigue cost him anything, the
laugh would justly be turned against him as a
dupe.  If it cost him nothing, the world would
storm at his meanness, but they would believe
in his power.

CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
PROPHECIES FULFILLED.
</h3>

<p>
"What makes you so serious to-day, Mrs. St. John?"
said Violet, about a week afterwards.
</p>

<p>
"I am getting anxious about my protégé.
It was my Julius who introduced her to the
notice of Sir Chetsom Chetsom; and I fear no
good will come of it."
</p>

<p>
"Are you, then, of the Walton party?"
asked Violet.  "And do you lend an ear to all
the scandal of that miserable place?  Consider
Sir Chetsom's age."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Rose; "but consider also his
pretensions.  We knew Sir Chetsom is old;
but he wants to be thought young."
</p>

<p>
"I assure you," said Mrs. St. John, "it
makes me very uneasy.  Julius has already
taken the liberty of speaking to him on the
subject, as strongly as he could; but Sir
Chetsom only laughed at what he called virtuous
scruples.  My only hope is, that Hester looks
upon their difference of age and station as a
sufficient warrant for an intimacy which she
would not otherwise allow.  And yet I fear
it is not so.  I hope I may wrong her.  I do
not wish to think uncharitably; but from
what I have observed of late, I think she is
ambitious and unscrupulous."
</p>

<p>
"We must remember," said Violet, "that
her very opinions on the emancipation of
woman would lead her to adopt a freedom of
manner, which, though it might be very
innocent, would be so unlike the conduct of
well-educated girls, that we, judging her by the
ordinary rules, should be guilty of great
injustice."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. St. John shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. St. John demurs," said Rose.
</p>

<p>
"I do, indeed.  I look with suspicion on
those opinions.  When I see a woman disdaining
the ordinary notions of society, I expect
to see her follow out her own opinions,
and disdain the ordinary practices of society."
</p>

<p>
Meredith Vyner joined them.
</p>

<p>
"We are discussing the old subject, Hester
Mason," said Mrs. St. John.
</p>

<p>
"And giving her all the virtues under the
sun, poetry included," said Vyner.  "Well,
you have chosen a good subject.  We don't
often meet with such a paragon.  Where,
indeed, in this prosaic place should we look for
such another
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cui Pudor, et Justitiæ soro<br>
  Incorrupta Fides, nudaque Veritas,<br>
  Quando ullum inveniet parem?<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"By the irony of your tone," said Mrs. St. John,
"I suspect you have heard something
new about her."
</p>

<p>
"No, nothing new; at least nothing unexpected."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?  Pray, let us hear it."
</p>

<p>
"The most natural thing in the world
she last night went off with Sir Chetsom
Chetsom.  <i>Interdum deliramus senes</i>, as Plautus
saith."
</p>

<p>
This information was received in silence.
Mrs. St. John coloured deeply, and then
turned pale.  She was greatly hurt, because
she considered herself in some measure the
cause of this misfortune, by having first brought
Hester into notice, and then having introduced
her to Sir Chetsom.
</p>

<p>
It was too true.  Hester had gone off; and
Sir Chetsom had taken good care that it should
not be a secret.
</p>

<p>
It would need a more graphic brush than
mine to paint the tumult of scandalized virtue
in Walton at this outrage upon public morals.
To paint the swelling indignation of Mrs. Ruddles,
the vehemence of offended purity in
Mrs. Spedley, the uplifted hands and eyes of
the mute but expressive post-mistress, the
sarcasms of Stone, the brutal jests of Spedley,
the moral declamation of the Rev. Richard
Ruddles, the sneers, the epithets of abuse, the
prophecies of what "her end would be," the
homilies on infidelity, poetry, and
"new-fangled notions," and the constantly-reiterated
but never-too-old reflections which each and
all made upon their own sagacity in having
"all along foreseen it."
</p>

<p>
The howl of Walton reached not Hester's
ears; and if it had, it would only have sounded
like the shouts of triumph in an ovation.

CHAPTER V.

THE ASTUTE MRS. VYNER.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On returning to the hall, Meredith Vyner found
a letter from Cecil.  He retired into his study;
for he was one of those who fancy that you
cannot possibly read anything with attention
elsewhere than in a study.  Having deliberately
adjusted his spectacles, and taken a liberal
pinch, he began the perusal.
</p>

<p>
Its contents may easily be guessed.  It was
very penitent, very clever, contained two adroit
quotations from 'Horace,' and a well-worked-up
petition for pardon.  Blanche signed it with
him, and added a pretty little postscript of her
own.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Meredith Vyner having learned from
Rose that a letter had arrived, the handwriting
of which looked like Cecil's, hastened to join
her husband, whom she found not only in his
own study, but in what is usually termed a
"brown study."  He was sitting in an easy-chair.
His body slightly bent forward; the
spectacles shifted from his nose to his forehead,
one arm resting on the inner part of his thigh,
the pendent hand grasping the opened letter,
the other arm resting on the table, the hand
caressing his snuff-box.
</p>

<p>
"So you have had a letter from your son-in-law?"
she said, as she entered.
</p>

<p>
He handed it to her.  She read it slowly.
On looking into his face as she returned it to
him, she saw that he had forgiven them.
</p>

<p>
"A very clever epistle," she said; "very
clever.  And of course you grant the pardon.
They know that very well.  They were quite
sure of that when they ran away, otherwise
Cecil would not have been such a fool; but he
knew your weakness&mdash;knew how easily you
were to be managed, and was quite sure that <i>I</i>
should never oppose him."
</p>

<p>
Meredith Vyner took a pinch, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we have them to live with us?  I dare
say that is what they expect&mdash;and, perhaps, it
would be the best.  Or do you intend making
them an allowance?"
</p>

<p>
Meredith Vyner took three pinches, rapidly.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, dear, I think, perhaps, it
would be as well not to relent at once, because
it will be such a precedent.  Keep them waiting
a little.  They will be all the more grateful
when it does come."
</p>

<p>
"And <i>who</i> said it was to come at all?" asked
the indignant Vyner.
</p>

<p>
"I took that for granted."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, of course, for granted.  Everybody
seems to take things in my house <i>for
granted</i>.  <i>I'm</i> not to be considered.  <i>My</i> wishes
are not to be consulted.  And yet I believe I
am master here&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;but I fancy
this house is mine."
</p>

<p>
His wife smiled inwardly, as she added,
"And your children's."
</p>

<p>
"How my children's?" he sharply asked.
"It is none of theirs; it will not even be theirs
at my death.  Theirs, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Meredith Vyner knew perfectly well
the effect to be produced by her apparently
careless phrases, and played upon her husband's
mind with a certainty of touch highly creditable
to her skill.
</p>

<p>
"I am surprised, my dear Mary, to hear you
talk so.  For granted, indeed!  No; it shall not
be for granted; it shall not be at all.  I will be
master in my own house.  I have already
submitted too much to my daughters; and they
shall find I will do so no more.  A pretty
thing, indeed, to brave her father, to bring a
slur upon her name by running away with a
penniless adventurer: a man I don't like; a
mere superficial dabbler, who pretends to
understand 'Horace,' and is quite at sea with
respect to the Horatian metres.  He'll never
do anything; never be anything.  And yet he
expects that he has only to write me a whining
letter, and all will be forgotten.  He doesn't
think it possible I can refuse.  No, no; takes
my pardon for granted.  But it is not granted.
It shall not be."
</p>

<p>
"This will soon blow over, I'm not at all
afraid for my dear Blanche.  You will not be
able to hold out long."
</p>

<p>
"There is your mistake."
</p>

<p>
"We shall see, we shall see," said she, with
a tone of most expressive certainty of the truth
of what she said, and left the room.
</p>

<p>
Meredith Vyner was seldom angry; but the
provoking confidence of his wife, in what he
chose to consider her opinion of his weakness,
made him furious against the cause thereof&mdash;the
offending Cecil.
</p>

<p>
From what impulses spring human actions!
Here is a man delighted by the opportunity
afforded him of forgiving his offending child,
and ready to clasp her to his bosom.  That
is the natural instinct of his heart.  His wife
comes; and, by pretending to urge the very
act he is about to perform, by choosing to
assume it as a settled thing, and insinuating
thereby, that, from his known weakness,
everybody must also assume it, she stifles the
parental feeling, awakens his miserable vanity,
and makes him exhibit his weakness by the
very action which he intends as a proof of his
fortitude and decision.
</p>

<p>
Resolved to show how mistaken those were
who fancied that he was to be led by the nose,
he sat down, and wrote this brief, and, as he
thought, crushing reply:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"WYTTON HALL, 10<i>th Nov.</i> 1840.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"SIR,
</p>

<p>
"You have made an error in your
calculations, I am not so easily bamboozled as
you imagine.  You are very clever, I have no
doubt; but,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">

</p>

<p class="noindent">
And with this I close all correspondence between us.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yours truly,<br>
  "H. S. MEREDITH VYNER."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"That quotation is rather happy," he said
to himself, as he folded the letter.  Indeed, so
pleased was he at its felicity, that it would
now have cost him some pangs not to send
the letter; he could not afford to lose such an
effect.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Meredith Vyner was very shortly after
found sobbing in her room, by Rose.  To the
anxious inquiries of the affectionate girl, at
first no other reply could be elicited than&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my poor Blanche! poor Blanche!"
accompanied by fresh sobs.
</p>

<p>
After about five minutes of this irritating
and inexplicit grief, Rose managed to ascertain
that Blanche was not to be forgiven.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" she exclaimed.  "Oh, I will
go this instant, and intercede for her!"
</p>

<p>
"Do, my dear&mdash;do&mdash;lose no time!  And,
Rose, don't mention that you have seen
me.  Pretend to know nothing, except that
Cecil has written; and ask your papa when
we are to see them, just as if it were
a matter of course that he would forgive
them."
</p>

<p>
"I will."
</p>

<p>
She went.  Her success may be imagined;
Vyner stormed at her; said, she was just like
her sister, and had been so long accustomed to
regard him as a cipher, that she could not even
suppose him capable of punishing such an act
of wretched disobedience.
</p>

<p>
On going to bed that night, Meredith Vyner
seemed to have become greatly pacified by the
day's reflections.
</p>

<p>
"It is rather a good letter that, of Cecil's,"
he said.  "Well expressed."
</p>

<p>
"Very," answered his wife.  "Perhaps
rather too well expressed for sincerity.  But
he's a clever fellow.  I always liked him.  He
is so gay and rattling."
</p>

<p>
"Better qualities in a guest than a son-in-law!"
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  That depends&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"His first quotation from Horace, too, is
very well chosen&mdash;pat and pointed.  Not so
good, though, as mine to him!  Egad! that
was a stinger.  Still, his deserves praise."
</p>

<p>
"I rather suspect, dear, that he made Horace
a go-between.  He pretended to be very
interested in the poet, in order that he might
woo the editor's daughter."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed, there you wrong him.  He
came to me at first purely out of love for
Horace.  He took great interest in my
commentary&mdash;I must do myself the justice to say
that it is a little out of the common&mdash;and he
seemed to think so.  He was never tired of it,
till his head got stuffed full of foolish love
nonsense.  When he began hankering after
Blanche, he left off reading my commentary.
Still I cannot deny that the great attraction
first was the study of my notes and emendations."
</p>

<p>
She saw that he was getting on dangerous
ground, and therefore threw out this lasso:
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, he knows your weak point, and
by that he will gain the day.  You won't long
be able to disown a son-in-law who can quote
Horace <i>àpropos</i>.  So that if your natural
goodness doesn't make you relent, Horace will!"
</p>

<p>
"You think so; but you are greatly mistaken."
</p>

<p>
In this way she from time to time restored
his faltering resolution.  Whenever symptoms
of relenting exhibited themselves, she contrived
to banish them by irritating his vanity.
Shakspeare, that great master of the human heart,
has, in the third act of <i>Othello</i>, anticipated the
scenes which are perpetually recurring between
a cool, calculating scoundrel and his writhing,
unsuspecting victim.  With consummate art, Iago
always manages to keep before Othello's mind,
the very idea he pretends to banish or to
palliate; and directly he sees his victim relenting,
as thoughts of tenderness for Desdemona arise,
Iago contrives that the very tenderness shall
add intensity to his sense of wrong.  For
instance, Othello says:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I do not think but Desdemona's honest.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Whereupon Iago, with brutal-seeming frankness,
says:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long live she so! and long live you to think so!<br>
  <i>Oth.</i>  And yet how nature erring from itself.<br>
  <i>Iago.</i>  Ay, there's the point&mdash;As&mdash;to be bold with you&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to affect many proposed matches, &c.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
With somewhat of the diabolical art Iago
used, did the sylph-like humpback play upon
her husband.  And when she began to fear that,
after all, she might lose the game, she adroitly
changed her tactics and said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It has occurred to me that there is a way
of settling this difficulty.  Do not countenance
Blanche's disobedience&mdash;do not see her
husband&mdash;but we can from time to time assist
them secretly.  I can give them money, as if
from my own funds.  You will not appear in
the matter at all, and yet you will have the
satisfaction of knowing they are not in want."
</p>

<p>
This seemed so admirably calculated to save
his dignity, and yet to preserve Blanche from
the more serious consequences of his refusal,
that he gladly adopted the suggestion.
</p>

<p>
Having gained this point, Mrs. Meredith
Vyner sallied forth to pay some visits to her
poor.
</p>

<p>
The devil is not so black as he is painted.
Mrs. Vyner had her good qualities: and she
was worshipped in her village.  No one was so
liberal to the poor; no one looked after the
schools with greater or more judicious care;
no one was more active in benevolence.  She
not only did kind things, she said them also;
and that is an element in benevolence many
charitable people omit.  She attended upon
the sick; she comforted the sorrowing; she
listened to their long stories; she gave them
advice; she interested herself in their joys and
sorrows.
</p>

<p>
From what we know of her, we shall not be
altogether dupes of this benevolence: we shall
not suppose it pure, unmixed kindness.  But
it would perhaps be grossly wronging her to
believe that it was hypocrisy, that it had not
some real good feeling at the bottom.  Although
we may, and not uncharitably, suppose
there was some selfishness and ostentation in
this care for the poor; we may also believe
that she felt some of the real glow of generosity
and delight in doing good.  In the ordinary
sense of the word, she had no "interest" in
her conduct.  She might have done her duty
to the poor without going so far as she did.
Their good opinion was of no "use" to her.
Examine it how you will, you can discover
none of the "interested motives" usually
supposed to influence the benevolence of selfish
people.
</p>

<p>
Such a character is a paradox; but only a
paradox, because we are so prone to regard
human nature as very simple and <i>all of a piece</i>,
when, in truth, it is, as I have remarked before,
marvellously complex.  Mrs. Meredith Vyner
was wicked, cruel, unloving, and selfish; it
would be a contradiction in terms, to add that
she was also kind, generous, and benevolent;
but it is perfectly true that she would occasionally
perform kind, generous, and benevolent
actions perfectly disinterested.  The secret I
take to be this.  Her cruelty was not wanton:
it always had reference to some selfish object.
But on occasions completely alien to her
interest or her vanity, she could be kind; and
being an impulsive, imaginative woman where
she <i>was</i> kind, she was strikingly so, thereby
turning it into a thing of <i>éclat</i>, and so
gratifying her vanity.
</p>

<p>
It was said of himself, by Benjamin Constant,
"<i>Je puis faire de bonnes et fortes actions; je ne
puis avoir de bons precédés.</i>"  This is a
revelation of the profound depths of certain minds;
and Mrs. Vyner belonged to that class.  In a
moment of enthusiasm she might even have
forgotten her selfishness&mdash;or rather have staked
all the gratification of her selfishness on the
triumph of one moment; but she could not
have completed her sacrifice, she could not
have gone through with any line of conduct
after it had lost its <i>éclat</i>; above all, she could
not, in the ordinary transactions of life, have
been generous, thoughtful, kind&mdash;she could not
go through "the little nameless unremembered
acts of kindness and of love" which
constitute real goodness.
</p>

<p>
Her conduct towards the poor seems to be
thus explained: they did not stand in her
light; nothing she could do, or omit to do for
them could influence her interests.  But they
were picturesque objects which struck her
imagination, and appealed to her protection.
A little trouble and a little money made her
their benefactress.  The pleasure of doing good
was a pleasure she could appreciate, and it
could be purchased for so little.
</p>

<p>
If any one supposes from the foregoing
remarks, that I have what is called <i>explained
away</i> her benevolence, he is mistaken.  There
are hundreds quite as selfish, who cannot
appreciate the pleasure of doing good; and she
is so far their superior.

CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
FAINT HEARTS AND FAIR LADIES.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  On this old beach<br>
  For hours she sat; and evermore her eye<br>
  Was busy in the distance, shaping things<br>
  That made her heart beat quick.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WORDSWORTH.&mdash;<i>Excursion.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Autumn was deepening fast.  The green tints
were rapidly disappearing, and the advancing
year "breathed a browner horror o'er the
woods."  Wytton still looked lovely; the great
variety of tints, from the dark brown of the
copper beech, to the delicate yellow of the
cut-leaved hornbeam, made the grounds as
splendid as a setting sun.  The paths strewed with
fallen leaves, spoke feelingly of the approaching
change, when the huge trees would be
stretching their melancholy branches out into
the air, in gaunt loneliness.
</p>

<p>
Preparations were being made to quit Wytton
for town, and both Marmaduke and Julius
looked with regret upon the approaching
separation.  Town would never replace the country
for them.  They would see their idols there, it is
true; but they would no longer see them in the
charming ease and <i>abandon</i> of Wytton Hall, or
the Grange.
</p>

<p>
The country is the place for a nascent love!
It affords endless opportunities of <i>tête-à-têtes</i>,
and the scenery gives a tone to the whole mind.
London is very well for a flirtation, or when
you cannot have the country.  But its riot and
bustle, its endless dissipation of your time and
distraction of your thoughts, would alone make
it greatly inferior to the country.  Shut up in
a country-house you have nothing to prevent an
eternal brooding over your own thoughts; and
those thoughts, can they be more sweetly
employed than in hovering round the image of
the beloved?
</p>

<p>
One bright, sunny, brisk, autumnal afternoon,
six horses stood saddled at the door of the hall.
A ride to the sea-shore, about eight miles
distant, had been determined on, Rose having
expressed a desire for a good childish ramble on
the sands to pick up shells, and crack the
seaweed pops.
</p>

<p>
Meredith Vyner, Mrs. St. John, Marmaduke
and Violet, Julius and Rose, formed the party.
Mrs. Vyner stayed at home.  All the visitors
had left the Hall, so that the present party was
as large as could be mustered.  They formed
three pleasant couples.
</p>

<p>
"I think the young people behind understand
each other," said Meredith Vyner to
Mrs. St. John, as they rode ahead.
</p>

<p>
"I wish they did," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"Do you then doubt it?  I fancy Mr. Ashley's
attentions are unmistakeable, and
Violet does not seem to look coldly on them.
She is less haughty to him than to most people.
Don't you think she's improved?  Ah! I
forgot, you did not know her then.  She used
to be a devil: such a temper!  My poor little
Mary, who, you know, is the timidest, mildest
creature alive, used to be frightened out of her
wits at her.  She never dared to suggest
anything that was not perfectly agreeable,
for Violet would burst out upon her&mdash;it was
quite fearful!  I never saw any of it myself.
Violet was always well behaved enough before
me.  But I used constantly to find Mary in
hysterics, or in tears; and although she always
wished to spare Violet, and refused to specify
what had been said and done, yet she could
not conceal from me that my daughter's
conduct was the cause of her emotion.
However, thank God! sending her away from home
seems to have tamed her.  She is not very
violent now, is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Violent!  I think she is entirely charming.
I know no girl possessing so much dignity and
directness of mind.  I quite love her."
</p>

<p>
"And what do you think of Mr. Ashley?"
</p>

<p>
"That he would make her an excellent
husband.  Julius, whose judgment is so good,
has the highest opinion of him."
</p>

<p>
"And I," said Vyner,&mdash;"not to flatter you&mdash;have
the highest opinion of your son Julius.
Upon my word, madam, you have a son to be
proud of, as Horace says&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Micat inter omnes<br>
  <i>Julium</i> sidus, velut inter ignes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luna minores.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A rare fellow; and one who, as a
son-in-law&mdash;&mdash;  Do you think there <i>is</i> anything
there?"
</p>

<p>
"With Rose?  I am puzzled.  Julius is
somewhat secret on such matters, and although
he admires Rose, I do not feel certain how far
his admiration goes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you may tell him that he has not
only my consent, but that nothing would please
me more than to call him my son.  Rose is a
good girl; somewhat saucy in her wit, which
does not even respect her mother at all times,
but there is no malice in her.  Mary, who
doats upon all my children as if they were her
own, says she cannot wonder that such girls
should exercise such empire over me; for
you must know, Mary fancies I am led by the
nose by my affection for the girls, and that
they have the whip hand, which is by no
means the case.  I may have indulged them,
perhaps, too much when they were younger;
but I flatter myself no one ever was able to
<i>lead</i> me."
</p>

<p>
It may be supposed, that during this ride,
neither Marmaduke and Violet, nor Julius and
Rose, were very silent; but their talk was made
up of those delicious nothings to which time,
place, and circumstance give significance, and
tones and looks give eloquence: what George
Sand finely calls <i>tous les riens immenses d'un
amour naissant</i>.  Haughty and impetuous as
Violet was, she had great playfulness, and could
unbend with bewitching ease.  Marmaduke was
also lively, and his animal spirits were
stimulated by his desire to please.  He was
charming.
</p>

<p>
Chamfort&mdash;who has written some of the wittiest
and profoundest aphorisms in the French
language&mdash;has said&mdash;"Un homme amoureux
est un homme qui veut être plus aimable qu'il
ne pent, et voilà pourquoi presque tous les
amoureux sont ridicules."
</p>

<p>
True enough: lovers do appear ridiculous
to lookers-on; but that desire to please which
prompts their words and actions, makes them
loveable in the eyes of their mistresses.  After
all, the great secret of being pleasant is the
wish to be so.  It needs no grace of manner,
no splendour of beauty or talent, to make all
around you pleased at your approach.  It only
needs the honest wish to please.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke was therefore charming in the
eyes of Violet, although he said nothing during
the whole of the ride, which could possibly be
read with interest.  His conversation was
frivolous or commonplace enough, but it had the
particular seal of amiability.
</p>

<p>
So also Rose, the witty, sparkling Rose,
laughed and made them laugh, without having
uttered a single joke fit to be repeated; because
if its wit happened to be undeniable, it would,
nevertheless, ill bear transplanting.
</p>

<p>
This is the dilemma into which a novelist is
forced if he chance to select a lively girl for a
heroine: either he must consent to suppress her
conversation, or else to give the impression of a
vulgar, personal, flippant, disagreeable creature.
In real life, vivacity gives point to a poor joke,
and carries off the coarseness from a personal
witticism.  A laughing girl, with roguish eyes,
and unmistakeable hilarity of manner, may
utter almost anything&mdash;commonplace or
personality&mdash;not only with impunity, but with
positive applause.  But I am certain that if the
conversation of lively young ladies were printed,
it would be scouted as the coarse daubing of
one who knew not what ladies were.  Simply
because a narrator can only give the words; he
cannot give tone and manner.
</p>

<p>
Be good enough to understand, therefore,
that Rose was provokingly witty, though I
cannot repeat what she said.  Take my word for it.
Repose upon the "easier-to-be-imagined-than-described"
belief.  Represent to yourself a
young and lively girl during a delightful canter,
with her lover by her side, whom she likes to
tease, and then "imagine" what conversation
must have passed: there <i>can</i> be no difficulty
about the wit, as you have to draw from your
own stores.
</p>

<p>
A happy day they passed.  The ride to the
sea-shore was through pleasant lanes, strewed
with fallen leaves; and the sea-shore itself
presented a magnificent view.  The tide was very
low, and the distant sands and sea had the
appearance of the early dawn of a summer's
day.  The sails of a fishing-smack or two dotted
the horizon.  A fresh, salt sea-weed fragrance
saluted their nostrils; the <i>scrunch</i> (beautiful
word!) of small shells and pebbles followed
their footsteps; small stranded crabs, with
incoherent efforts, were hurrying here and there;
huge entangled masses of weed offered their
pops to Rose's delicate fingers; and a basketful
of beautiful shells was soon the result of their
search.
</p>

<p>
In this extremely primitive occupation, the
time fled on.  Meredith Vyner had wandered a
long way down the shore, talking to Mrs. St. John
respecting the virtues and accomplishments
of his wife, and the manner in which
his girls repaid her affection; which was
followed up by a circumstantial history of his
commentary on Horace: how the idea first
came to him in reading a variorum edition: how
the more he learned to know the commentators,
the more he had learned to despise them, and
to feel that a new edition was imperatively
called for: how he had worked for years at this
edition, and how, in short, he had finally got
together the materials from which his monument
would be built.
</p>

<p>
The tide was fast returning, and a rolling sea
poured its restless waters, like the plunging of a
powerful steed.  Violet, seated on a rock, was
contemplating it in silence; in silence Marmaduke
dropped little pebbles into a tiny pool of
water left in the rock.  Both were sad, but with
the sadness which is sweeter than joy.  Both
were silent, but with the silence which is more
eloquent than speech.  The breeze was playing
with their hair, the music of "old ocean's roar"
was sounding in their ears; the declining rays
of an autumnal sun gave a poetic splendour to
the scene, which was disturbed by no sound
save the ceaseless wash of the advancing tide as
it rolled upon the shingle.
</p>

<p>
It was one of those exquisite moments when
the soul seems to tremble with delight at every
thought which crosses it, when the susceptibility
to external influences is so keen that the veriest
trifles are robed in the splendour of imagination,
and a scene which at other times would
attract, perhaps, but little attention, has the
enchantment of Armida's gardens.  There are
moments when the soul, with a vague but
irresistible yearning, seems anxious to burst
its earthly bonds, and to identify itself with
the great spirit of beauty which hovers over
the world&mdash;moments when the desire to love
is so imperious, when the soul so eagerly seeks
communion with some other soul, that the
being, whom at other times we have perhaps
regarded as indifferent, suddenly becomes the
idol to whom a heart is offered as a sacrifice.
The halo of mysterious feelings is around that
being's head, and we mistake it for the
luminous glory which encircles the Chosen.
Just as the feeling of the moment sheds its
lustre over a common-place scene, will it make
an idol out of a common-place person.
</p>

<p>
How many fatal mistakes in love are attributable
to such illusions?
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke and Violet were both under the
spell of such a feeling.  Yet neither spoke;
words were too imperfect to express what
passed within them.  He rolled his pebbles
one after the other into the pool, with
mechanical precision; she watched the broad
advancing sea, and listened to its music.
</p>

<p>
Had he declared his passion at that moment,
he would assuredly have been accepted; and
the whole course of their lives would have been
altered.  But he paused; he "dallied with the
faint surmise;" he played with his own heart,
and waited for her to break the silence.
</p>

<p>
But she kept her eyes upon the advancing
sea, and a sigh, a gentle sigh heaved her bosom,
for by some accidental association the current
of her thoughts had become changed: she
ceased to think of Marmaduke, and was
communing in spirit with her departed mother.
Perhaps it was the dash of the waters on the
shore which brought back to her recollection
those days of her unhappy childhood, when
having lost her mother, she was wont to sit
upon a rock, and hear the ocean speak to her
wild words of comfort.  There were voices in
the waves then; and those voices faintly sounding
through the past, spoke to her mysteriously
now.  The image of her dear, kind, much-loved
mother, stood before her.  A tear rolled
over her cheek; and Marmaduke, whose attention
had been attracted by her sigh, looked up
and saw it.  His heart was proud, for he
thought that sigh and that tear were for him.
</p>

<p>
"What are you thinking of?" he tenderly asked.
</p>

<p>
She turned her full large eyes, glistening
with grief, upon him, and said gently,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My poor mother!"
</p>

<p>
And again her eyes were fixed upon the sea.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke was hurt; and with a movement
of impatience resumed his pebble rolling.
His self-love shrank, offended at this
unexpected avowal, and he mentally reproached
Violet with her coldness.
</p>

<p>
"She loves me not," he said.  "Will she
ever love me?  Am I wasting my affections
here as I wasted them before?  Well, she
shall see that I can be as cold and proud as
herself."
</p>

<p>
In this frame of mind he remained seated by
her side, making no attempt to withdraw her
from the reverie in which she was indulging,
and with the sullen bitterness of a lover,
refusing to enter upon a conversation which
would have dissipated all his doubts, and made
him the happiest of men.
</p>

<p>
Julius and Rose having finished their
collection of shells, and having immensely enjoyed
each other's society, though not a word of love
had crossed their lips, came up to the rock
and found the silent lovers not unwilling to
prepare for the ride home.  As they all four
walked to the spot where the servants were
with the horses, Marmaduke took Julius by the
arm, and falling a few paces in the rear, said
hurriedly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Julius, laugh and joke as much as you
please, but if the warning does not come too
late, take care of your heart!"
</p>

<p>
"Explain, explain."
</p>

<p>
"Do not trust yourself&mdash;do not believe that
you can read a woman's heart from her
behaviour&mdash;do not make the mistake I have
made."
</p>

<p>
He refused to be more explicit, but Julius
fancied he comprehended his meaning.  With
a truly human <i>naïveté</i>, Marmaduke imagined
that as <i>he</i> had been deceived, his friend would
likewise be so; and in perfect sincerity he
counselled Julius not to believe in Rose's
manner, because Violet's manner, as he
supposed, had been deceptive to him.
</p>

<p>
To another the advice would have been idle;
to Julius it was agitating, and confirmed him
in his natural backwardness to believe a
woman could fancy him: a backwardness
which Rose's manner had of late so far
overcome, that he had been several times on the
point of declaring himself, and would I dare
say have done so during their ride home, had
not Marmaduke's earnest warning held him
back.
</p>

<p>
Violet, pensive and sad, rode home occupied
with her own thoughts: Marmaduke at her
side scarcely making an observation.  Rose, as
gay and fascinating as before, noticed a change
in Julius, but said nothing to him about it,
as she suspected love was at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
"I have finished my third reading of
Leopardi's poems," she said presently, "and like
them more and more.  Their constant sadness
is a great charm to me&mdash;I suppose, because
having no sorrows of my own, I love to
indulge in imaginary woes."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he replied, "tears were given to
man to purify him.  So natural is sorrow to us,
that if we have it not, we invent it; the heart
would dry up and wither, if it were not watered
by the blessed fountain of pity.  But
Leopardi's sorrows were in excess, and became a
mental disease.  Smitten as he was in body,
heart, and mind, by disease, slighted love, and
scepticism, no wonder that his poems are
melancholy."
</p>

<p>
"Was he then slighted in love?"
</p>

<p>
"He loved&mdash;loved twice&mdash;but each time the
offering of his heart was rejected.  What else
could the poor hunchbacked, crippled poet,
expect?"
</p>

<p>
"If he was a cripple, was he not a great
poet?  If his back was ill-shaped, was not his
mind noble?"
</p>

<p>
"His <i>mind</i>!" replied Julius, with a tinge of
bitterness.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, "his mind: could not a
woman appreciate that?"
</p>

<p>
"Women can appreciate a mind, but they
cannot love it.  Love springs from sympathy,
not from intelligence: its seat is in the heart,
not in the reason.  A woman might therefore
have admired Leopardi; but she could not love
the cripple."
</p>

<p>
"Yet, did not Mademoiselle d'Aubigny
marry the cripple Scarron?"
</p>

<p>
"To become Madame de Maintenon," replied Julius.
</p>

<p>
"I would cite a dozen other instances.  Do
you know, Mr. St. John, you are very
ungallant in your opinion of our sex&mdash;which sex
you can know very little about, to judge from
your exaggerated notion of our regard for
beauty.  We like to keep the beauty to
ourselves.  As for me, I would as soon marry a
hunchback as a guardsman, as far as the mere
beauty is concerned."
</p>

<p>
A strange joy filled his heart as she said this,
and he was about to declare himself, when
Meredith Vyner called to him to ride forward
and admire a little valley which lay to their
left.  Rose fell back and joined her sister.
The rest of the ride was performed in threes,
instead of in couples.  As they reached home,
Vyner made his favourite quotation:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Heu! heu! quantus equis, quantus adest viris<br>
  Sudor!<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And conducted Mrs. St. John into the
drawing-room.  Marmaduke, Violet, and Rose,
followed them.  Julius went into the study to
write a note.

CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
BOLD STROKE FOR A LOVER.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  Ah, cruel! tu m'as trop entendue!<br>
  Je t'en ai dit assez pour te tirer d'erreur.<br>
  Eh bien! connois donc Phèdre en toute sa fureur<br>
  Je t'aime!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RACINE.&mdash;<i>Phèdre.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Do you never sing, Mrs. Vyner?" asked
Mrs. St. John, as she saw her beating time
with her head (and curious time it was!) to
Violet's singing.
</p>

<p>
"No; I have so little voice."
</p>

<p>
"That surprises me; I should have thought
you must sing well, your speaking voice is so
soft."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Meredith Vyner smiled her acknowledgments,
and redoubled the energy of her
impossible time-beating.  Marmaduke, charmed
by the magic of Violet's singing, was gradually
overcoming his anger, and was slowly admitting
to himself what a divine creature she
was.
</p>

<p>
She ceased, and Marmaduke prayed so
earnestly for her to continue, that she again
sat down, and while her rich contralto notes
were making every chord in his heart vibrate,
he suddenly encountered the savage gaze of
his former "tiger-eyed" mistress.  She rapidly
closed and then opened her eyes, with that
manner peculiar to her, and which I have
mentioned before, and a smile dethroned the
look of hate which the previous instant had
usurped her face; but he marked the change,
and smiled scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"What a beautiful voice she has!" said
Mrs. St. John.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Mrs. Vyner; "but we prefer
Blanche's singing&mdash;she has so much <i>feeling</i>.
Violet, you know, has more of the professional
mechanism; but Blanche has a soul in
her singing."
</p>

<p>
As Blanche was a rival out of the way, it
was safe to cry up her attraction, especially
at the expense of one of the other girls.  Violet
was perfectly aware of what her mother
meant, but she was not the less nettled.  As
she was about to commence another song,
Mrs. Vyner said,
</p>

<p>
"There, my dear, that will do; you have
displayed your accomplishments quite enough,
and it is unnecessary for Mr. Ashley to listen
to any more songs sung out of tune, however
curious the ornaments may be."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Vyner must have been very irritated,
to have made a remark so plainly and directly
disparaging and unkind!
</p>

<p>
"Did you notice that I sang out of tune,
Mr. Ashley?" Violet quietly asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  In fact, as far as I may be
allowed an opinion, I should say your
intonation is remarkably perfect."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am glad you are not so severe a
critic as mama," replied Violet, with a calmness
which was horribly exasperating, "because,
as she cannot distinguish one tune from
another, her ears are so delicate that it is
difficult to keep in tune to them."
</p>

<p>
This sarcasm, in answer to the petty spiteful
remark which called it forth, produced
an uncomfortable silence, which Violet broke
by beginning Paisiello's magnificent <i>Ho
perduto il bel sembiante</i>, which she sang with
triumphant energy and steadiness, showing
how little the ignoble squabble had disturbed
her.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Meredith Vyner was pale with hate,
but the twilight covered her paleness.  In her
rage at Violet's haughty sarcasm, and jealousy
at seeing Marmaduke so enraptured with her,
she resolved upon a diabolical resolve: she
would regain Marmaduke's love, and break
Violet's heart!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Julius was in the study writing
this epistle:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dearest Rose, I can no longer restrain
myself, I can no longer hesitate and live in
doubt.  I love you.  You must know it; and
what you said not an hour ago makes me
bold.  Do you remember your words, 'As
for me, I would as soon marry a hunchback as
a guardsman, so far as beauty is concerned.'  They
were sincerely spoken, were they not?
At any rate 'upon that hint I speak,' and
conscious of my own unattractiveness dare to
hope my ugliness will not be a barrier to your
affection.  Do not ridicule my presumption, I
entreat; look on it as an unhappy passion,
which your own confession has urged me to
declare.  Even now I dare not tell you to your
face I love you; partly because I still fear the
avowal might distress you, and partly because
the courage I shall need to bear with a refusal,
would desert me.
</p>

<p>
"Examine your own heart calmly, and if
it tells you that you could be happy with me&mdash;if
it tells you that the devotion of my life
would make up for all the superior attractions,
mental and physical, in which I am deficient&mdash;then,
as you come down to dinner to-day,
bring in your hand the volume of Leopardi,
and place it on the table.  By that token,
which can have no significance to others, I
shall learn that I am not scorned.  If your
heart does not speak in my favour, the mere
omission of this will tell me too plainly, but in
the least cruel manner, that I have made a
sad mistake."
</p>

<p>
This was folded up into a tiny note, and
with it Julius marched into the drawing-room
to seek some means of delivering it.  He
found Rose playing with Shot, and stooping
down to join her in that play, he easily contrived
to slip it into her hand, just as the lamp
was brought in.  She blushed deeply, and her
little bosom panted with hurrying feelings;
but making an effort she ran out of the room,
declaring it was time to dress for dinner.
</p>

<p>
She read the letter with intense eagerness,
and finished it twice before she could make
out distinctly anything beyond the delightful
fact that Julius had at last declared himself.
On calming her agitation a little, and deliberately
reading the letter once more, she felt
a certain impatience at that passage which
attributed the declaration to what she had
said during their ride.  For the first time, it
then struck her that she had given him too
broad a hint.  Aware of his backwardness, and
of his exaggerated notion of woman's desire for
beauty, she was anxious to undeceive him on
that point, and now saw that she had, perhaps,
overstepped the bounds of maidenly reserve.
</p>

<p>
Now Rose, though a darling little girl, was
not without her imperfections; and wilfulness
was among them.  She would do and say
strange things, because she chose to do and
say them; but you were not to draw any
absolute conclusions from them, you were not to
hold her to her words unless she also chose to
be held to them; she called that taking an
advantage of her.  In the present case she was
very anxious to tell Julius that she loved
him; she had gone so far as to tell him that
his want of beauty would be no disqualification;
yet when he availed himself of her
words, and "spake upon that hint," she
rebelled, and was impatient at such an advantage
being taken of her "unguarded language."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the dressing-bell had rung, and
no one was in the drawing-room except
Marmaduke and Mrs. Meredith Vyner, who were
in the midst of a somewhat bitter and mutually
reproachful conversation respecting the
honesty and constancy of the two sexes.
</p>

<p>
"Men are so brutal," she said; "they
always demand undying constancy from us&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And never get it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And even when perhaps jealousy, anger,
or despair have driven us into seeking elsewhere
for relief from our outraged affections,
they sneer and talk of our frivolity and
incapacity for an enduring passion."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, it is easy to talk of jealousy
driving a woman to extremity, but there must
be shown some cause for that jealousy.  Mere
<i>absence</i>, mere inferiority in position, is sometimes
enough to suggest ample cause for jealousy.
An absent lover thinks incessantly of his
mistress; a rich old lover makes his appearance;
whereupon the engaged lady suddenly becomes
jealous of her absent swain, and, <i>driven
to desperation</i>, marries the rich old lover!"
</p>

<p>
Nothing could better please Mrs. Vyner than
the turn taken by the conversation, which, in its
generality of expression and covert significance,
best answered her purpose of justification,
without seeming to justify herself.
</p>

<p>
"I agree with you.  There must be ampler
cause shown.  But if the absent lover suddenly
ceases to write, and reports arise that he
is very assiduous in his attentions elsewhere, if
to this silence, confirmed by these reports&mdash;if
to the jealous rage, which those who love
ardently must feel when they are betrayed,
be added the temptation of vengeance in the
shape of a brilliant match, then, I think, we
should not blame a woman's inconstancy, so
much as we should pity her fate.  Were she to
marry a young and handsome man, she might
be supposed to love him; but if, as in the case
supposed by you, the new lover be old, then it
is a proof that whatever wild motives may
have prompted her wild act, inconstancy in her
affections had nothing to do with it."
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke was a good deal shaken by
this artful speech, but he rather felt than
saw its falsehood.  A shrug of the shoulders,
and a slight incredulous laugh was all the
answer he vouchsafed.
</p>

<p>
"There is this further difference," she
pursued, "between the sexes.  When a man has
quarrelled with a woman&mdash;when he has
deserted her or been deserted by her, he tramples
down in his heart all former love, and
replaces adoration with hate, or, at the least,
with indifference."
</p>

<p>
"Very right too."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you men think so.  But how differently
a woman feels!  Under the same circumstances,
whatever may have been prompted by
her rage or her despair, the act upon which she
had resolved once performed, her love returns
with all its former force&mdash;returns and lives in
her heart throughout the rest of her life.  This
is what I mean by our superiority in
constancy.  When once we love, it is for ever.
No neglect, no ill-usage, no inconstancy can
kill it.  Weak and wayward, reckless and
passionate as we are, we rush into wretched
extremes, we do rash things when blinded
by our tears, but do what we will, we cannot
stifle the love that is in our hearts."
</p>

<p>
The little creature had risen and thrown
back her golden locks with the graceful fury
of a Pythoness, her eyes sparkled with an
unwonted light, her nostrils were dilated, her
whole frame seemed animated with passion, as
she declaimed, rather than spoke, that
vindication of herself in her sex.
</p>

<p>
I have said before that she had the nature
of an actress.  The present scene, therefore,
was not only adapted to her histrionic display,
but gave her such keen delight, that she could
have pursued it for a long while, quite
independent of any ulterior purpose, had not
Marmaduke suddenly arrested her eloquence, by
asking in a tone of subdued irony,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And am I expected to believe all this?"
</p>

<p>
She paused to fix a passionate look at him.
Then, slowly drawing from her bosom a small
locket, held it up to him, and said scornfully,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Do you recognise <i>this</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Before he had recovered from his astonishment,
she had left the room.
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" he exclaimed.  "It is my hair!"
</p>

<p>
<i>It was her father's.</i>

CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
WOMAN'S CAPRICE.

<p class="poem2">
  Quelque raison qu'on trouve à l'amour qui nous dompte,<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We left Rose pondering over her lover's letter,
and her own uneasiness at having by her hints
called forth a delightful declaration.  We
return to her after the lapse of half an hour,
and find her in the same state.  At length the
dinner-bell rings.
</p>

<p>
The volume of Leopardi lies on the table:
will she take it down with her?
</p>

<p>
There is a fact in human nature which will
be familiar to many, but which I am unable to
explain, and that is the occasional impulse
which forces us to act diametrically opposite
to our wishes.  It is a sudden spasm of
wilfulness, wholly irrational, but wholly
irresistible.  I know that, in my own case, I have
refused advantageous offers&mdash;declined invitations
to pleasant excursions&mdash;entirely in obedience
to this impulse of wilfulness&mdash;which I
have regretted the instant afterwards, when
either circumstances or my pride made the
regret unavailing.  No reason, no gratification
of any vanity, indolence, or temper has been
at the bottom of this.  The impulse has been
purely wilful and irrational&mdash;motiveless, were
not the motive enveloped in the very impulse.
</p>

<p>
I call attention to this fact, as a fact, because
it helps me to explain Rose's sudden resolution
not to take down the volume of Leopardi.
Perhaps, in her case, there may have been
some acknowledged influence derived from her
annoyance at that passage in Julius's letter,
which threw the onus of the situation upon
her.  Perhaps she might have been secretly
anxious to show him that she was not so ready
to throw herself into his arms as he might
suppose.  I know not how it may be; all I
know is, that with a sudden effort she walked
down stairs, came into the drawing-room, saw
the death-like paleness of her miserable lover,
whose hopes had been thus scattered by a
blow, seated herself upon a <i>vis-à-vis</i>, and joined
in the conversation as if nothing had occurred.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to say that Julius was prepared
for this, that his own diffidence had
perpetually taught him to expect it; he had
thought so, too, and yet he was not prepared.
We sophisticate with ourselves quite as much
as with others.  We say we are prepared for
an event which, if it occurs, takes us with the
suddenness of a blow to a blind man.  And
Julius, when he saw Rose enter without the
token, felt as if a grave had suddenly yawned
at his feet.  "Marmaduke was right!" he
said, and instantly turned over the leaves of
the "Book of Beauty," which was on the
table.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke, whom we left bewildered at
the discovery of Mrs. Meredith Vyner's
long-cherished affection, had not yet recovered from
the agitation into which it had thrown him.
The announcement that Mrs. Vyner was too
unwell to descend to dinner&mdash;having been
seized with one of her singular hysterical
fits&mdash;added to the tumult of his thoughts; for
he readily divined the cause of that fit, and
her wish also not again to meet him that
evening.
</p>

<p>
It is needless to say, how gratified he was.
In his own eyes he had been rehabilitated.
From the position of a jilted lover, he was
raised to that of one loved, "not wisely, but
too well;" and the keen delight it gave to his
self-love was something quite indescribable.
</p>

<p>
From a sort of instinctive feeling of delicacy,
he kept away from Violet's side.  Rose occupied
him entirely.
</p>

<p>
Julius was, therefore, enabled to hand Violet
to dinner without any embarrassment.  He was
cold, grave, and dignified; speaking little, but
that little without bitterness, without covert
allusions.  You only noticed that he was
grave&mdash;not that he was hurt.
</p>

<p>
Rose was somewhat piqued.  She knew
that she had done wrong, was sorry that
she had done it, but yet could not without
impatience see the dignified reproof which
there was in Julius's manner.  Willing enough
to repair by a word the error she had committed,
she expected, indeed required, that he
at least should show sufficient concern to
induce her to repair it.
</p>

<p>
This is not very amiable, perhaps, but it is
human nature.  In a moment of capriciousness,
she had rejected his proffered love; not
that she meant to reject it, but simply because
she chose to indulge her wilfulness.  She
intended to release him from despair, as soon as
her rejection had produced it; she had never
thought of his leaving the house that evening,
without a full assurance of her love.  But
now all her plans were overthrown.  He
exhibited no despair.  His cold, grave manner
was more like a stern reproof of her
capriciousness, than the despair of a lover.  Her
rejection had been accepted; and she was
angry with him for taking her at a word.
</p>

<p>
Violet was puzzled at the little attention
Marmaduke paid her, and more puzzled at
his eyes never meeting hers as they were
wont, to mingle their lustre with each other;
and observing also the change in Julius, she
began to speculate on the probable cause.
Was Marmaduke suddenly smitten with Rose,
and was Julius jealous of him?
</p>

<p>
It was a solemn, tedious dinner.  Fortunately,
Meredith Vyner had begun upon the inexhaustible
subject of English etymologies, and
talked enough not to observe the silence of
the others.  When the ladies withdrew, he
entered into a discussion with Marmaduke,
on the comparative merits of ancient and
modern poetry, while Julius carefully cut some
apple peel into minute slips.
</p>

<p>
They remained much longer than usual
over their wine; and when they returned to
the drawing-room, Julius missed the sweet
glad smile of welcome with which Rose
greeted him, by studiously looking another
way.
</p>

<p>
The change of feeling in a loving heart is
very rapid from anger to sorrow, and Rose
had long since lost all sense of pique, for one
of sorrowful alarm.  During the time the
gentlemen had remained over their wine, she
had reflected on the whole affair, and
penitently avowed her folly.  Her only course was
to undo what she had done; and the smile
with which she greeted him was meant as the
first intimation of her changed opinion.
</p>

<p>
But Julius neither saw that smile, nor
afforded her the slightest opportunity of
speaking to him; and&mdash;strange contradiction in
human impulses!&mdash;the more he wrapped
himself in his reserve, the more abject was
her humility in endeavouring to draw him out
of it.
</p>

<p>
At length she fled to her own room, resolved
to bring down the Leopardi, and hand
it to him, saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"There is the book you ought to have had
before dinner."
</p>

<p>
But when she reached her room, she was
forced to vent her pent-up feelings in a flood
of tears&mdash;and bitter-sweet those tears were:
bitter in remembrance of the past, sweet in
anticipation of the future.  Having calmed
herself by "a good cry," she had then to
wash her face and eyes, to remove all traces
of her grief.  This took some little time.
</p>

<p>
When perfectly satisfied with her appearance,
she took up the volume, kissed it fervently,
and tripped down stairs.  She found
Violet alone leaning her magnificent arm upon
the table in an attitude of profound meditation.
</p>

<p>
"Where... where are .... they?" Rose
faltered out.
</p>

<p>
"The St. Johns?  Gone this quarter of an hour."
</p>

<p>
"Gone!" exclaimed Rose in an agonized
voice, and sank into a chair, with a terrible
presentiment of some tragic results from her
absurd caprice.

CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
CONSEQUENCES.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean&mdash;<br>
  Tears from the depth of some divine despair<br>
  Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,<br>
  In looking on the happy autumn fields,<br>
  And thinking of the days that are no more.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TENNYSON.&mdash;<i>The Princess.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A restless, agitated night was it for the four
lovers.  Julius sat up packing.  He had
informed his mother of his rejection; and she,
doating as she did on her son, was highly
indignant at Rose's "unfeeling coquetry, which
she never could have believed her guilty
of."  Espousing his cause with a vehemence which
somewhat hurt him, she readily agreed to his
proposal of their both leaving the Grange
forthwith, and spending the winter in Italy.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke also packed up that night.  He
had quarrelled with Julius, and was determined
to quit the Grange early in the morning.  The
subject of their quarrel had been the two girls,
whom Marmaduke accused of being heartless
coquettes, which Julius angrily denied.  High
words passed; for both were in a state of
extraordinary agitation, from the events of
the night.
</p>

<p>
Having completed his arrangements, he threw
himself upon his bed, but not to sleep.  Strange
visions came to him&mdash;phantasmagoria, in which
the image of the imperial Violet was ever and
anon floating before the passionate figure of
the sylph-like Mrs. Vyner, as she last appeared
to him, proclaiming woman's undying love.
Gradually his thoughts settled more and more
upon the latter.  He began to consider the
various parts of her story, and to compare it
with the facts.  Then a new light broke in
upon him.  It is one of the effects of oratory,
that your ears are charmed, your mind borne
away along the stream of eloquence or
argument, without having time to pause and
examine; but subsequent reflection often suffices
to break the spell, and the enthusiastic
applauder votes against the very sentiments he
has applauded.  So Marmaduke had been
carried away by the skilfully constructed tale
which Mrs. Vyner had improvised; and the
plausibility of the non-receipt of letters, and
reports of his attentions to another, had been
so great as really to have made him doubt
the justness of his old convictions.  But,
on reflection, that plausibility vanished.  He
remembered that his letters had been received
and acknowledged until within a very short
time of the announcement of her marriage.
He also remembered that he had been so
occupied with affairs as to have had no time
even for ordinary society in Brazil; so that
no innocent flirtation with any girl there
could at that time, by any possibility, have
given rise to the reports by which she
pretended to have been made jealous.
</p>

<p>
It was evident, therefore, that she was
deceiving him again.  For some purpose or other,
she was playing with him.
</p>

<p>
"I will get to the bottom of this mystery,"
he said.  "One of two things it must be:
either she really loves me, in spite of all&mdash;and,
in that case, I will profit by it,&mdash;or else
she is again coquetting with me for some
purpose, or out of mere love of coquetry;
and, in that case, I will avenge the past.  She
is as cunning as the devil!  To dupe her, I
must feign the dupe."
</p>

<p>
He turned upon his pillow with a chuckle of
triumph.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Meredith Vyner slept soundly that
night.  A smile was on her lips as she sank
asleep&mdash;a smile of gratulation at the success
of her experiment on Marmaduke.  She was
sure that he was in her power.
</p>

<p>
Rose could only stay her grief by the
recollection that to-morrow would explain away
all that was now doubt and misgiving.  She
intended to call early at the Grange, and
frankly tell Julius that she loved him.
Nevertheless, in spite of this resolution, a dark
presentiment overshadowed her soul, and drove
away the thoughts of happiness.  She wept
abundantly; sometimes at her own folly, sometimes
in anger at Julius, for having so brutally
taken her at her word, as if a woman's negative
was ever to be taken, when looks and words
had so often affirmed what was then denied.
He ought to have known she was only teazing
him; that it was only a spurt of caprice.  He
must have known it.  But he did not choose
to see it.  He wanted to make her unhappy!
A fresh flood of tears closed this tirade.  And
so on, throughout the long and weary night.
</p>

<p>
Violet having heard from Rose the real
state of the case, was relieved from jealousy
only to be plunged into fresh doubt.  What
could be the meaning of Marmaduke's
conduct?  They had not quarrelled.  She had
said nothing to offend him; nor did he seem
offended; and yet....
</p>

<p>
For the first time, Violet now became
distinctly conscious that she loved Marmaduke.
His fearlessness, manliness, and frankness had
early captivated her,&mdash;to say nothing of his
handsome person.  Increased intimacy had
shown her, as she thought, a heart and mind
every way worthy of her love.  But a certain
mistrust&mdash;perhaps a recollection of her
inclination towards Cecil, perhaps a vague sense
of imperfect sympathy with Marmaduke&mdash;had
kept her more reserved than was her wont;
and this reserve was attributed to haughtiness.
The chance of losing him, however,
awakened her to a conviction of what the loss
would be.
</p>

<p>
Day dawned; and with the dawn Julius set
out for London.  Marmaduke followed, at
about nine o'clock.  At eleven, Rose and
Violet called in the carriage at the Grange.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. St. John is gone to Walton," said the
butler.
</p>

<p>
"Is Mr. Julius at home?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Julius is gone to London."
</p>

<p>
"To London?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, miss; he went early this morning."
</p>

<p>
Rose sank back in the carriage, too overcome to weep.
</p>

<p>
"Is Mr. Ashley within?" asked Violet.
</p>

<p>
"He's also gone to London, miss."
</p>

<p>
It was evident that they were both deserted
by their lovers.  They drove back in horrible
silence.
</p>

<p>
After luncheon, they again called at the
Grange&mdash;Mrs. St. John had gone out for the
day.  The next day they called&mdash;Mrs. St. John
had gone to London.
</p>

<p>
It would be painful to dwell on the sufferings
of these two girls.  Wounded pride, wounded
love, baffled hope, and wearing doubt were the
vultures consuming their hearts.
</p>

<p>
The next morning's post relieved some of
Violet's fears, by bringing her father a letter
from Marmaduke, apologizing for not having
called to take leave of a family from whom he
had received so much kindness, and with whom
he had spent such happy hours; but being
forced, by his quarrel with Julius, to quit the
house at the very earliest, he trusted the
omission of a farewell visit would be excused;
the more so, as the Vyners were themselves
very shortly to come to London, when he
hoped to do himself the pleasure of paying
them his respects in person, and in person to
thank them for their hospitable kindness.
</p>

<p>
This proved that he at least had not departed
in anger.  Mrs. Vyner secretly rejoiced at the
event, attributing his flight to a sudden resolution
to quit her dangerous presence, and attributing
the letter to an uncontrollable desire to
be with her again.
</p>

<p>
To Rose this brought no consolation.  She
had none, except that she must see or meet
Mrs. St. John in London, and that she could
then explain to her the whole affair.
</p>

<p>
How eagerly these three women longed to be
in London, and with what feverish impatience
they set out, when the day at length arrived.

CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
THE BOARDING-HOUSE.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
<i>Mathew</i>.  Now trust me you have an exceeding fine lodging
here, very neat and private.
</p>

<p class="intro">
<i>Boladil</i>.  Ay, sir: sit down, I pray you.  Master Mathew,
in any case possess no gentlemen of our acquaintance with
notice of my lodging.  Not that I need to care who know it,
for the cabin is convenient; but in regard I would not be too
popular and generally visited as some are.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BEN JONSON.&mdash;<i>Every Man in his Humour.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Returned from their honeymoon, Blanche
and Cecil began to look about them, and
examine the state of their prospects.  Her
father had refused, as we have seen, to
countenance the match; so that from him neither
patronage nor money could be expected.
Cecil called upon several of his influential
friends, to see if any "gentlemanly situation"
was open to his acceptance.  I need not say
how fruitless were those applications.
</p>

<p>
Yet "something must be done," he constantly
observed.  A wife was a responsibility
which made him serious; and despairing of&mdash;for
the present at least&mdash;obtaining any consul-ship
or government office suitable to his
pretensions, he determined to make a name in
literature or art.  That name would either be
the means of enriching him, as an admiring
public enriches a favourite, or else would give
him a greater "claim" on patrons.
</p>

<p>
Cecil was vain and ambitious, and from his
boyhood upwards had been desirous of creating
for himself a reputation equal if not
surpassing those whose names he heard sounded
in every society.  But, although he was very
clever and unusually accomplished, he had as
yet taken no serious steps towards that lofty
object.  He wanted that energetic will which
must nerve every man who attempts to do
great things; "to scorn delights and live
laborious days."  He was unequal to the
perpetually-renewing sacrifice which lies at the
bottom of all great achievements in art,
literature, or science; the sacrifice, not of one
temptation, not of one advantage, but of
constant temptations.  The artist is as one who,
spending day after day in a luxuriant garden,
must resist the temptation of culling the
flowers that grow to his hand, of fruits that
glisten before his eyes, and subduing the
natural desire of man for instant fruition, consent
to pass by these temptations, and, with spade
and hoe, proceed to that work which, after
much stedfast labour, much watchful care,
will in due season produce fruits and flowers
equal to those around him.  The delight of
seeing his labour crowned with such results;
of watching the nursling of his care thus
growing up into matchless beauty, is a delight
more rapturous than the enjoyment of all the
other fruit could have given him.  But, nevertheless,
that delight is purchased by a sacrifice
of present small enjoyments for future pleasures
of a higher kind; and the sacrifice of
the present to the future is that which
ordinary men are perhaps least able to accomplish.
</p>

<p>
Cecil wanted the animal energy and resolution
necessary for empire over himself.
Much as he wished for reputation, he could
not nerve himself to the labour of creating it.
He was conscious of a certain power, and
flattered himself that he could at any time
succeed, whenever he chose to make an effort.
But he could not make the effort.  Parties of
pleasure could not be refused; pleasant books
could not be left unread; concerts and
musical societies could not be declined.  In short,
one way and another, he "never found time"
to devote himself to any work.  There were
so many "calls upon his time;" he had so
many engagements; his days were so broken
in upon.
</p>

<p>
Thus had he gone on idling and dreaming;
coveting reputation, but shrinking from the
means; dissipating his talent in album
sketches, fancy portraits, album verses, and
drawing-room ballads.  His sketches were
greatly admired; his verses were in request;
his music was sung; and everybody said,
"How amazingly clever he is!  What he might
do, if he chose!"
</p>

<p>
But now poverty came as a stimulus to
exertion.  It was now a matter of necessity
that he should work; and with cheerful
confidence he sketched out the plan of his
career.
</p>

<p>
His first step was to advertise in the <i>Times</i>
for board and lodging on moderate terms, as
their income was too small for an establishment
of their own; and Blanche had never
been initiated into the mysteries of housekeeping.
To judge from the number of answers
he received, one would imagine that a certain
class of the English people were bitten with a
singular mania&mdash;that of taking houses "too
large for them," and the consequent desire
"to part with the upper portion" to a genteel
married couple, or a quiet bachelor.  Why
will people thus shirk the truth?  Why not
say at once that they are poor, and want their
rent and taxes paid?
</p>

<p>
Well, among these answers there was one
which particularly struck Cecil.  It was from
a widow living at Notting Hill.  Omnibuses
passing the door every ten minutes; the quiet,
unpretending comforts of a home; strictest
attention to the respectability of the inmates,
and sixty pounds a year for a married couple's
board and lodging, were the inestimable
advantages offered to the advertiser.  The
situation and the terms so well suited Cecil's
present position, that he determined to look at the
place.
</p>

<p>
The boarding-houses of London are of every
possible description; from splendour to pinching,
almost squalid poverty.  That kept by
Mrs. Tring was a type of its class, and merits
a fuller description than I shall be able to
give of it.  The first aspect of it produced a
chill upon Cecil.  He had taken Blanche with
him; and on arriving they were shown into
the front parlour, with the information that
Mrs. Tring would be "down directly."
</p>

<p>
It must be a beautiful room, indeed, which
can be agreeable in such moments.  I know
few things more unsatisfactory than that of
waiting for a stranger in a strange house.
But the cold, cheerless, rigid, poverty-stricken
appearance of Mrs. Tring's parlour, would
at all times have made Cecil uncomfortable:
how much more so now that he was
contemplating living there!  The drab who
officiated as maid, with flaunting cap-ribands,
slip-shod feet, and fiery hands,&mdash;a synthesis of
rags and dirt,&mdash;came in to light the fire; a
proceeding which only made the room colder
and more uncomfortable than before, besides
the addition of smoke.
</p>

<p>
The parlour had a desolate appearance.
All the chairs were ranged in order against
the wainscot, as if no one had sat in them
for months.  Not a book, not a bit of
needlework, not even a cat betrayed habitation.
The settled gloom seemed to have driven
away all animated beings from its prosaic
solitude.  The furniture was old, dingy,
scrupulously clean, invalided, melancholy; it did
not seem as if it had been worn to its present
dinginess, but as if it had darkened under
years of silence and neglect.
</p>

<p>
The Kidderminster carpet was of a plain,
dark pattern, selected for its non-betrayal of
stains and dirt; it was faded indeed, but
in nowise worn.  The hearth rug was rolled
up before the fender.  In the centre of the
room was a square table, covered with a
dark-green cloth, on which some ancient ink spots
told of days when it had been used.  Six
black horse-hair chairs with mahogany backs,
and one footstool retiring into a corner&mdash;a
portrait of a gentleman, executed in a style
of stern art, dark red curtains, and two large
shells upon the mantelpiece, complete the
inventory of this parlour, which in Mrs. Tring's
establishment was set apart for the
reception of visitors, and those who came to
treat with her for board and lodging.
</p>

<p>
The want of comfort of this room did not
arise from its appearance of poverty so much
as from its cold pinched look.  It was a
poverty which had no poetry in it&mdash;nothing
picturesque, nor careless and hearty.  Between
it and the parlour of poor people in general,
there was just the difference between a woman
dressed in a silk dress which has been dyed,
then has faded, and is now worn with a
bonnet which was once new, and a woman
dressed in plain, common, but fresh
wholesome-looking gingham, which she wears with
as much ease as if it were of the costliest
material.  It had the musty smell of an
uninhabited room, and the melancholy aspect
of a room that was uninhabitable.  A sordid
meanness was plainly marked upon it,
together with an attempt at "appearances,"
which showed that it was as ostentatious as
the means allowed.  It was genteel and desolate.
</p>

<p>
Cecil looked at Blanche to see what
impression it had made upon her; but the mild
eyes of his beloved seemed to have noticed
nothing but his presence, which was sufficient
for her happiness.  It suddenly occurred
to him, that the more wretched the
appearance of his home, the more likely would
Vyner be to relent when he heard of it; and
this thought dissipated his objections to the
place.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tring shortly entered, with very
evident marks of having just attired herself to
receive them.  Her presence was necessary
to complete the picture; or rather, the room
formed a fitting frame for the portrait of the
mistress.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tring was the widow of a curate, who,
astounding and paradoxical as the fact may
appear, had not left her with an indefinite
number of destitute children.  No: for the
benefit of the Statistical Society the fact shall be
recorded.  Mrs. Tring, though a curate's wife,
had never borne a child; she had been left
penniless but childless.  When I say penniless,
I use, of course, merely a well-sounding
word.  The literal truth is, that although he
left her no money, he had left her the means
of earning a subsistence, by opening her house
as one in which single ladies, single
gentlemen, and married people could be lodged
and boarded at a very moderate sum.  The
furniture was her own.  Her boarders paid
her rent, taxes, dress, and little expenses; and
thus Mrs. Tring contrived to live, but not
without a hard struggle!  It was barely a
subsistence, and even that was precarious.
</p>

<p>
Her personal appearance was not pleasantly
prepossessing.  She was horribly thin: with a
yellow withered face, which seemed to have
been sharpened by constant struggles to gain
farthings, and constant sorrows at disbursing
pence.  She wore a black net cap, and a black
silk dress, white at the seams from age, the
shape of which had outlived a thousand
fashions, and taxed the most retentive memory
to specify when it had been the mode.  It was
a low dress, and a piece of net fastened by a
large brooch served to conceal her yellow
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
In manner she was stiff, uneasy, and yet
servile.  She spoke with a sort of retention of
her breath, and an intensity of mildness, as if
she feared, that unless a strong restraint were
exercised, she should burst forth into
vehemence; she agreed, unreservedly, to everything
said, as if, had she ventured to contradict
a word, it would have infallibly betrayed
her temper.
</p>

<p>
To her visitors she displayed all her
amiability, and acceded to every proposition with
such good-humoured alacrity, that terms were
soon agreed upon.  For the sum of sixty
pounds per annum, payable monthly in
advance, they were to have the back bed-room on
the second floor, unfurnished, and their meals
with the family: these meals to consist of a
breakfast at nine, luncheon at one, dinner at
five, and tea at eight.
</p>

<p>
"We live plainly," said Mrs. Tring, "but
wholesomely; luxuries are, of course, out of
the question, yet my inmates have always been
satisfied."
</p>

<p>
"As I have not the slightest doubt we shall
be," replied Cecil; "I like simple food.  What
other inmates are there, pray?"
</p>

<p>
"The front bed-room on the second floor is
occupied by an old gentleman who was in a
government office, and is now living on his
pension: a charming person, though a little
deaf.  The room next to his belongs to an
Irish widow, a Mrs. Merryweather&mdash;I don't
know whether you are acquainted with her, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Cecil smilingly replied, that he had not that
honour.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you might, sir; she has seen
a great deal of society, and is a very lively
lady.  In the room above hers, we have a Miss
Bachelor, a maiden lady&mdash;very gifted, sir.
She teaches music in some of the best families.
The third back is let to a Mr. Roberts, a
young gentleman in the city, who only
breakfasts with us."
</p>

<p>
Cecil bowed on receiving this information,
which promised him that the fellow-boarders
would, at least, afford some amusement to
make up for the dreariness of the house.  He
announced his intention of taking up his abode
there on the morrow.  Accordingly, having
moved what furniture he possessed, with some
necessary additions, into the room he was now
to call his own, and having hired in town a
painting-room, which he fitted up for writing
as well as painting, and moved his piano into
it, he took his young bride to Mrs. Tring's
house, and there they installed themselves,
with some merriment at the shifts to which
the want of space forced them.
</p>

<p>
It was late in the evening when they took
possession, and they preferred not presenting
themselves to their fellow boarders until the
morning.
</p>

<p>
"This is a sorry home to bring you to,
dearest," he said, as the servant, having lighted
his candles and asked if he had any orders to
give, left the room.
</p>

<p>
Blanche twined her arms round his neck,
and said tenderly to him: "Can that be a
sorry home where love resides?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Blanche, no," he replied, kissing her
forehead, "I was wrong.  Love creates its own
palaces; and we shall be as happy here, as if
we had a splendid seat.  We are starting
anew in the world&mdash;it is well to start from low
ground, because the smallest ascent has then
its proper value.  Here will I build myself a
name that shall make you an envied wife."
</p>

<p>
"I am already enviable&mdash;ought I to wish
for more?"
</p>

<p>
What a delightful evening they spent,
arranging their property in the most convenient
places, and then sitting over the fire discussing
future plans radiant in the far-off sunshine
of Hope.  That little room&mdash;what a world it
was!  In the corner stood their bed,&mdash;in the
centre a round table,&mdash;in another corner a
small bookcase&mdash;by the window a toilet table.
Nothing could be more cozy, they said.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
INMATES OF A SUBURBAN BOARDING-HOUSE.
</h3>

<p>
Next morning at breakfast Mrs. Tring's
inmates assembled, and the new comers were
duly introduced to their future companions.
The breakfast was plain, and passed off rather
uncomfortably, a feeling of restraint checking
merriment.  As the boarders descended one
by one, and were presented to Cecil and his
wife, an unanimity in commonplaces formed
the staple of remark, and every one seemed
unwilling to unbend before having closely
scrutinized the new comers.  Small communications
respecting the state of the health,
and of the good or bad night's rest, were
confidentially whispered in corners; while daring
prophecies on the subject of the weather were
more audibly pronounced.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Revell, the ex-official, ate in solemn
silence; Mrs. Merryweather, the lively Irish
lady, was patronizing and polite; Miss
Bachelor, as demure as a well-fed cat; Mr. Roberts,
a dapper clerk with a rosy face and well-oiled
hair, was the only person apparently
undaunted by the presence of strangers, and
rattled on with more confidence than wit,
until the half hour warned him of the
approach of his omnibus, when he buttoned his
single-breasted frock-coat up to the neck,
passed on to his red fingers a close-fitting pair
of doe-skin gloves, rolled the silk of his
umbrella into the smallest possible compass,
and departed with the indelible conviction of
being "about the neatest dressed man to be
met in a day's walk."
</p>

<p>
Breakfast did not last long.  Mr. Revell
then engaged himself in assiduous study of the
second day's <i>Times</i>, the only vestige of a
paper which found its way into that forlorn
place.  Mrs. Tring departed to look after her
household concerns, leaving her boarders to
their usual chat in the back parlour, until
their bed-rooms were ready for their reception.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Merryweather began to unbend, and
Cecil feared that her liveliness might prove
more tiresome than her reserve.  She was
a great talker of inconceivable small talk;
launched upon the endless sea of personal
reminiscence, she told stories with all the
minute detail of a professed <i>conteur</i>, excited
attention by the ample paraphernalia of an
anecdote, and baulked it by ending without a
point.  Of all bores, this species is the worst:
it is the bore obtrusive and inevitable.  Other
bores can, with some adroitness, be managed,
they do not unchain your attention; but
the story-teller fastens upon your attention
by artful preparations, and though you have
been disappointed a hundred times, experience
is of no use, for your interest is
involuntarily accorded on every succeeding
occasion.
</p>

<p>
To escape from the torrent of talk which was
thus loosened upon him, Cecil sat down to the
piano, and ran his fingers over the keys, after
which he begged Miss Bachelor to favour the
company with a taste of her quality.  After
the necessary hesitation and apologies, she sat
down.  From a teacher of music he anticipated
a sort of railway rattle; but Miss
Bachelor agreeably disappointed him by the
modest execution of a sonata by Dussek: it
was a mild, feeble, performance, unpretending
as the performer, and infinitely preferable to
Mrs. Merryweather's stories.  He then sang
a duet with Blanche, then a solo, and then
another duet.  This concluded, he observed
that Mrs. Merryweather had retired, and he
followed her example.
</p>

<p>
"I can't say much for our society," he said
to his wife, as they went out for a stroll.
</p>

<p>
"We shall not see much of it, you
know.  We have our own room," replied
Blanche.
</p>

<p>
"True; but while I am at work?"
</p>

<p>
"I can think of you!"
</p>

<p>
There was no reply to this, but to press the
arm that leaned on his, closer to his side, and
to look fondly in her loving face.
</p>

<p>
During their walk, they discussed their
plans again with that inexhaustible interest
which the future always has to the young and
struggling; and they returned to dinner with
a good appetite.
</p>

<p>
A significant smile was exchanged between
Mrs. Merryweather and Miss Bachelor, and
then between the ladies and Mr. Revell, as a
handsome piece of ribs of beef was placed
upon the table.  Cecil noticed it, but failed
to comprehend its meaning.  He observed
also that the hostess carved, and would by no
means consent to his relieving her of the
trouble; a procedure which the exiguity of
the single slice placed upon each plate fully
explained.
</p>

<p>
"May I trouble you for a little horse-radish?"
he suddenly asked.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Merryweather and Miss Bachelor&mdash;astonishment
snatching up their eyebrows&mdash;simultaneously
ceased eating.  Mr. Revell,
whose deafness prevented his astonishment,
ate on.  Ask for horse-radish!  There was
something bewildering in the very extravagance
of the expectation.
</p>

<p>
In silence, they awaited Mrs. Tring's reply.
</p>

<p>
"Horse-radish!" said that lady, with intense
suavity.  "Dear me! how very forgetful of
me.  But we never eat it ourselves; and it
never occurred to me that you might like it.
Very forgetful; very forgetful, indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, do not say a word about it.  I
care very little for it&mdash;only a matter of
habit."
</p>

<p>
Emboldened by this audacity in the newcomer,
Miss Bachelor ventured to think she
could eat another cut of beef.  Mrs. Tring,
scowlingly, and in the most repressed tone,
suggested the propriety of keeping a
corner for the second course; to which Miss
Bachelor assented, now fairly unable to
conceive the immensity of the revolution which
the appearance of the Chamberlaynes had
created.  A second course!  Visions of
pheasants&mdash;perhaps even grouse&mdash;darkened her
bewildered brain.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Revell, as usual, had heard nothing, but
sent up his plate for a second help; to all
Mrs. Tring's shouts about "keeping a corner,"
imperturbably answering, "Yes, rather well
done; and a bit of fat."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Merryweather remembered how on
one occasion she was dining at Colonel James's
who had married an old schoolfellow of hers,
the daughter of the man who for so many
years kept the What's-the-name hotel in
Jermyn Street, where the Polish count stayed
so many weeks, and was so like Thaddeus of
Warsaw, only his name was Winsky, and he
came from Cracow, and about whom there
was that tragical story; how one night as he
was walking down Regent Street, when he
was suddenly felled by a blow on the head,
and was taken senseless to his hotel.  It was
a most extraordinary occurrence, and excited
a great deal of talk at the time; but
Mrs. Merryweather could not at that instant
remember the exact circumstances.  But,
however, that was neither here nor there.  What
she was going to say was, that her old
school-fellow had married Colonel James&mdash;quite the
gentleman&mdash;and often invited her to dinner;
very good dinners they were too; plenty of
wine and delicacies of the season&mdash;peas when
they first came in, and all that sort of thing;
well, one day&mdash;she never could forget it, live
as long as she might&mdash;she had eaten so plentifully
of the first course, a delicious saddle of
mutton, that when the game arrived&mdash;she had
not anticipated game&mdash;she was scarcely able
to touch it; and Colonel James, with his
usual affability, observed, "Ah, Mrs. Merryweather,
you should have kept a corner for
the second course."
</p>

<p>
This thrilling anecdote being ended, the
beef was removed.  Cecil was not a little
amused when he saw that an apple pudding
constituted this famous second course.  But
as, in the memory of man and boarder, no
precedent for such an extravagance as pudding
with hot meat had been known at Mrs. Tring's,
the ladies were quite satisfied that
such a second course should appear at all.
The only misgiving in their minds, was
whether such cheer was to become habitual;
or was it simply an illusive and treacherous
display for that occasion only?
</p>

<p>
A Dutch cheese followed the pudding, and
there the dinner terminated.
</p>

<p>
Accustomed as Blanche and Cecil had been
to the luxuries and refinements of their
station, it may be supposed that this ignoble
boarding-house was very repugnant to them,
and that they suffered bitterly from the change.
It was not so, however.  Change is so pleasant
to every human being, that, provided it
be abrupt and striking enough to produce a
vivid sense of contrast, it is eminently
agreeable.  The man who most enjoys a
well-appointed table, whose pride it is to have
his dinners served with the care and
splendour bestowed upon banquets, will also
enjoy "roughing it," and picking the leg of a
fowl with no fork but his fingers, no plate
but a hunch of bread.  We like from time
to time to feel ourselves superior to
conveniences, superior to our wealth and its
advantages.
</p>

<p>
The change was quite abrupt enough to
make Cecil and his wife enjoy it; and on
retiring to rest that night, they were as happy
as affection could make them.

HAPPY LABOUR, HAPPY LIFE.

<p class="intro">
Si modo dignum aliquid elaborare et efficere velint,

solitudinem recedendum est.
</p>

<p class="intro">
TACITUS.&mdash;<i>De Oratoribus.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The splendours of the first day were never
renewed.  Exhausted munificence sank quietly
back into ancient close-fistedness.  Mrs. Tring
had given one banquet, but every day was not
to be a holiday, as Mrs. Merryweather and Miss
Bachelor mournfully confessed, when, on the
succeeding morning, they found themselves
returned to the salt butter, drenched tea, and
implacable coffee, from which they had been
one morning released.  Still more dolorous
was the aspect of the dinner.  A return was
made to the primitive allowance of one potato
for each person, and the bread was as stale as
before.
</p>

<p>
Cecil was of course chary of making complaints,
but as he could not eat salt butter, quietly
contented himself with dry toast: a proceeding
which gained him the respect of Mrs. Tring, as
it saved just so much butter.  It was an
ill-advised act, however, as it gave her the courage
to make several other petty retrenchments&mdash;too
petty for him to speak about&mdash;yet, nevertheless,
annoying.  He had not been there a
fortnight before he determined on not staying
beyond the three months for which he had
taken his room.  Having thus made up his
mind that the annoyances were but temporary,
he was enabled to bear them with tolerable
stoicism.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Tring had to make a living out of her
boarders, and as she accepted such very low
terms, the reader may imagine what nice
calculations and minute economies were necessary.
The house was, indeed, a field of battle,
wherein, by adroit generalship, she every day
gained a victory.  The living was pitiable, and
Cecil was forced, in self-defence, to keep a
small provision in a store closet, from which he
and his wife satisfied the appetite which
Mrs. Tring's fare had stimulated, not appeased.  It
sometimes went so far as his sending out for a
chop, which he cooked in his little room, over
his dwarf fire.  Nevertheless, with all the extra
expenses into which scanty fare forced him,
the place was remarkably convenient from its
cheapness; and they both supported the little
discomforts with happy light-heartedness.
</p>

<p>
Cecil was full of projects.  He had begun a
picture of considerable pretensions, the
conception of which was not without grandeur: it
was Nero playing while he gazed upon the
blazing city of Rome.  He had also sketched
the libretto of a comic opera, of which he was
to write both words and music.  Gay and
lighthearted as the hopeful and employed
always are, the best qualities of his nature were
brought out, and Blanche adored him, if
possible, more than ever.  Work&mdash;which was given
to man that he might learn to know his excellence,
and to know the pleasure which attends
the full development of every faculty&mdash;work
crowded the hours with significance, and gave
to life a purpose; and Love illumined with its
sunshine the difficult path which stretched
itself before him.  Never, no never, had Cecil
known happiness till that time.  He had
squandered the riches of his nature as he had
squandered the heritage of his parents; and
now he came to know the value of what he had
lost.  A serious ambition occupied him, a
happy affection blessed him.
</p>

<p>
Oh! who shall paint the luminous picture of
their quiet life, which, to ordinary eyes, was so
prosaic and insignificant!  In that miserable
house, where meanness hourly struggled with
adversity, there was a small room, which was
parlour, bed-room, and sometimes kitchen, all
in one; and from the contemplation of which,
when you were told that in it lived a pair who
had been reared in luxury and refinement, you
would have turned away with painful pity.
Yet were the secret history of that seemingly
unfortunate pair known, your pity would
change into envy, as those four miserable
walls changed into a temple of Love, Youth,
and Hope.
</p>

<p>
Poverty&mdash;a word of terror&mdash;is only terrible
to the rich.  The poor are not really the
unhappy, for happiness is wholly independent of
our worldly goods and chattels.  If poverty has
its hardships, wealth has its annoyances.  If
wealth can satisfy caprices, when satisfied they
do not give the same delight as the cheap
enjoyments from time to time indulged in by
the poor.  All things are precious in proportion
to the difficulty of obtaining them, and the
very facilities of wealth take from enjoyments
their zest.
</p>

<p>
What makes poverty terrible is its proximity
to want.  And as want itself is often a thing of
degree, the rich imagine that any deprivation
of their accustomed indulgences must necessarily
be a serious evil.  But, in truth, the
human mind is so constituted as to adapt itself
to every condition, and to draw from its own
health the requisites of happiness.
</p>

<p>
Blanche and Cecil were poor, but they had
visions of future wealth and prosperity; meanwhile
they had the glorious certainty of mutual
affection, which irradiated their humble home,
and made each hour of their lives worth more
than all Peru could purchase.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
HOW MRS. VYNER WAS BENEFICENT.
</h3>

<p>
One morning while Cecil was in his studio,
smoking a cigar and contemplating the sketch
of his picture on the easel, with the air of a
man who profoundly meditates on the details
of a great conception, Blanche was in her
room at Notting-hill, making the essence of
coffee with a French machine, which they had
purchased (unable to drink the incomprehensible
mixture Mrs. Tring set before them)
when a carriage drove up to the door.  Blanche
did not hear it, as her room was situated at
the back.  It was with great surprise, therefore,
that she saw her mother and Rose rush
into the room, and bound into her arms.
</p>

<p>
After the first hearty embraces and
inquiries were over, Blanche became aware of the
condition in which she was found, and blushed.
It was not that she herself felt ashamed of
her poverty, but she was hurt at the reflections
which must necessarily arise in their minds
respecting the folly of her marriage; so she
hastened, in rather a precipitate and clumsy
manner, to assure them how exquisitely happy
she was.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God for that!" exclaimed Mrs. Meredith
Vyner.  "Then I have nothing to
reproach myself with for not having
interfered&mdash;for not putting a stop to Cecil's
attentions&mdash;which I very early noticed, let me tell
you.  The only thing I now desire is to bring
your papa round; but he is so obstinate!  I
do my utmost&mdash;but I almost begin to fear that
my intercession only makes him more
resolved; and I suspect if we were never to
mention the subject to him, he would relent
very speedily.  But depend upon me, my dear,
for looking after your interests."
</p>

<p>
"Dearest mama!" said Blanche, gratefully
kissing her.
</p>

<p>
"As soon as I see him relenting, I will
contrive to throw him in your way&mdash;and you can
then manage him yourself&mdash;but do not attempt
to see him till I give you the word."
</p>

<p>
"I will be guided by you."
</p>

<p>
Rose was unusually grave and silent.
Blanche noticed it, and noticed also that she
looked ill.
</p>

<p>
"I have been unwell," Rose said; "but I
am getting better now.  A slight fever, that
is all."
</p>

<p>
"And how is Marmaduke Ashley?" asked Blanche.
</p>

<p>
"Very well; we saw him yesterday; in
fact we see him very often now," Mrs. Vyner
answered; "somehow or other he has always
some commission to execute for one of us,
and as he is an agreeable companion, we make
much of him."
</p>

<p>
"And how gets on the flirtation with Violet?"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;pretty much as usual.  I suspect
it is only a flirtation just yet; or else he is
kept at a respectful distance, for you know
dear Violet is not the most affable of
beauties."
</p>

<p>
"And Julius, Rose, how is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, I cannot tell you," quietly answered
Rose.
</p>

<p>
"You can't!  What! do you mean to say,
Rose, that&mdash;&mdash;."
</p>

<p>
"He is in Italy, I believe," she said,
interrupting her sister, but showing no more
emotion on her face than if she were speaking
of the most indifferent person.
</p>

<p>
Blanche was not deceived, however; she
knew her sister's love for Julius, and divined
a quarrel.
</p>

<p>
"That is the slight fever!" she mentally
exclaimed; and then comparing her lot with
that of her two sisters, felt it was infinitely
preferable.
</p>

<p>
After a two hours' chat, they rose to depart.
The real purpose of Mrs. Vyner's visit was
to give Blanche fifty pounds, which her father
had sent her, in accordance with the arranged
plan that she was to suppose it came from her
mother.
</p>

<p>
"And now before I go, dear Blanche,"
said Mrs. Vyner, "I have to give you an
earnest of your not being forgotten by me,
however your father may act.  Money from
him, he vows, is out of the question; he will
not give a sixpence.  But out of my own
privy purse, I shall from time to time take
care of you.  There, dear girl, take that;
</p>

<p class="t3">
  The gift is sma', but love is a'.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I have set aside this fifty pounds&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She was interrupted by Blanche throwing
her arms round her neck, and hugging her
tightly, while tears of gratitude stood in her
eyes, and she murmured "Dearest, kindest,
mama!"
</p>

<p>
Rose, who was equally taken by surprise at
this <i>coup-de-theatre</i>, also sprang up and kissed
her mother, exclaiming,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I wish Violet were here!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Vyner understood the wish, and looked
delighted.
</p>

<p>
"One day," she said, with the meekness of
a martyr, "she will learn to know me."
</p>

<p>
It was an exciting scene.  Blanche and
Rose were affected, as kind hearts always are
at any action which bears the stamp of
kindness; and Mrs. Vyner was affected, as most
people are when they have done a generous
action, with a certain inward glow of noble
pleasure.
</p>

<p>
For do not suppose that she remembered
at this moment whence the money actually
came.  Not she.  In her excitable mind, the
means were lost in the end.  She had given
the money, she had aroused the gratitude of
the two girls, and as far as her feeling of the
matter went, she felt just as if the money had
been hers.  Indeed, so truly was she possessed
with this idea, so actually generous did
she feel in that moment of excitement, that
on opening her purse to take out the notes,
she found another ten-pound note beside it,
really her own, and taking it also out she said
as she presented it,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"There, you may as well have that too&mdash;you
will find plenty of use for it&mdash;and I shall
not miss it.  There.  Only be happy, and
trust in me."
</p>

<p>
The sudden impulse which led her to do
this&mdash;to complete as it were the action which
she had begun with such applause&mdash;to
redouble the effect of what had already been
created&mdash;will be understood by all who have
known, and knowing have analyzed, such
characters as Mrs. Vyner; to others it will
appear a gross inconsistency.

CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
THE CURSE OF IDLENESS.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Or fia dunque giammai, che tu, Ozio, possi esser grato
veramente, se non quando succedi a degne occupazioni.  L'ozio

</p>

<p class="intro">
GIORDANO BRUNO.&mdash;<i>Spaccio.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The consequences of this little scene were
manifold.
</p>

<p>
"Papa," said Violet to her father on the
following day, "you have done what I knew
you would do, and what I accept as a presage
for the future."
</p>

<p>
"And what is that, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Sent Blanche some money."
</p>

<p>
"Who told you so?" exclaimed he, greatly
surprised.
</p>

<p>
"I divined it," she answered, with a quiet
smile.
</p>

<p>
"You ... you are mistaken, Violet, ... I
send ... I have renounced her."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but your heart speaks for her in
secret, and in secret you send money.  Though
I question whether sixty pounds..."
</p>

<p>
"Fifty," interrupted her father.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then, you did know of it?" she said,
archly.
</p>

<p>
Meredith Vyner bit his lip.
</p>

<p>
"Sixty was the sum Mama gave, at any
rate, because Rose, who was present, told me so."
</p>

<p>
"Kind, generous creature!" ejaculated
Vyner.  "She must have added the other
ten from her own purse.  Violet, you have
guessed aright, but keep the secret, unless
you wish me to withhold even my underhand
charity from your wretched sister."
</p>

<p>
Violet promised to do so; but how great
was her scorn of her mother's hypocrisy, when
she thus found her suspicions verified!  From
her knowledge of her father and mother, she
had at once guessed the real state of the case,
and confusedly, but strongly, suspected the
motive of the latter.
</p>

<p>
This was the way in which their mutual
hatred was nourished.  Violet was not a dupe,
and her mother saw that she was not.
</p>

<p>
On Cecil, the influence of this gift was
fatal.
</p>

<p>
"This comes most fortunately," he said;
"for not only do I now begin to see that
our income is barely sufficient to meet our
scanty expenditure, but the more I advance
in my 'Nero,' the more am I impressed with
the necessity for not hurrying it.  All great
works demand time and labour.  Were I to
hurry the execution I should spoil it, and
too much depends upon success for me to
be precipitate."
</p>

<p>
He was sincere in saying so; he was his
own dupe in asserting that what he most
needed was ample leisure in which to elaborate
his conception.  He caught at the excuse
offered to his idleness, and like all men, covered
his weakness in the imposing folds of an
aphorism.  The brain is singularly fertile in
inventing plausible reasons to excuse weaknesses.
</p>

<p>
Labour is a sublime necessity: it is beneficence
under a rude aspect.  But although so
beneficent to man, it is radically antipathetic
to his nature.  All men are <i>constrained</i> to work.
Poverty or ambition are the invariable
taskmasters, and it is only by dint of the strong
stimulus of want, or the stronger dictates of
indomitable will, that human nature, vagabond
as are its tendencies, can be made to persevere
in the tasks set before it.
</p>

<p>
What wonder, then, if men under all
conditions avidly seize upon every occasion
which enables them for a moment to escape
from the tyranny of work?  What wonder if
this weak, wayward, susceptible Cecil, who had
laboured cheerily under the impulsion of
necessity, now forgot the sweet delights of his
daily task, and relapsed into his old habits of
dreaming idleness?
</p>

<p>
There was no longer any remarkable hurry.
His daily existence did not depend upon the
immediate accomplishment of his task.  He
could wait, he could mature his plans, he could
work only when the inspiration came to him;
there was no need to harass an unwilling;
brain, he could bide his time.  To any one
who knew him, it would be easy to foresee
that from the moment he was released from
the immediate necessity of labour, his time
would be frittered away in sterile efforts.  It
is only genius, which, goaded by an irresistible
inward impulse to transmute into art all that
it has felt, labours with courageous love, and
sings because it cannot choose but sing.  Talent
of every kind needs an external stimulus, and
Cecil was a man of talent, not a man of genius.
</p>

<p>
Blanche confirmed him in his opinions;
partly, perhaps, out of sincere belief in him
and in all he said, which made her think he
could not be in error; partly, also, out of a
little egotism of love which made her rejoice
in every hour that he could snatch from labour
to spend at her side.  He was so loveable,
that she would deserve pardon, even if her
sex's ignorance of life had not concealed from
her the enormity of her fault.  There was
something so caressing in his manner, that few
people withstood it; and to her he was the
perfection of tenderness, delicacy and
amiability.  Persons of his lively, susceptible
organization, are usually fascinating in their
manners&mdash;there is a <i>laisser aller</i> (which in him
was tempered with perfect good breeding), a
frankness, a gaiety, and a general consideration
for the feelings and opinions of others, founded
on a desire of universal approbation, which
create more regard than great qualities in a
less agreeable exterior.  If he was charming
to others, what was he to the wife he loved!
</p>

<p>
She wished to have him with her, and he
was but too glad to gratify her wish.  A little
excursion to Richmond occupied one day; a
visit to some Exhibition broke in upon another.
There were always pleasant walks and satisfactory
excuses.  He was not idle, he said; his
brain was working, his ideas were gradually
becoming clearer; the details stood out more
distinctly in his imagination; and 'Nero' would
benefit by this delay.
</p>

<p>
The effect of alms is always enervating,
however it may relieve a present want; and the
contributions of Mrs. Vyner were a species of
alms.  This was the case with Cecil.  His sense
of independence&mdash;his healthy confidence in
his own powers&mdash;becomes destroyed.  Had
Vyner made a distinct allowance to his
daughter, it would have then formed a certain
part of their income, and Cecil would have no
more relaxed his efforts than he did when his
own small but definite income was all he could
rely on.  But this uncertain charity&mdash;this
indefinite alms-giving which Mrs. Vyner's
first gift seemed to indicate, had the injurious
effect of all unascertained indeterminate
assistance: it made Cecil rely on it as on a
fund.
</p>

<p>
In this mental analysis I am exhibiting
motives in all their nudity, but the reader will
not suppose that because I drag them into the
light of day, they were as clear to Cecil, in
whose breast they were enveloped in the
sophisms and obscurities with which men hide
from themselves their own infirmities.
</p>

<p>
As Cecil sat after breakfast smoking his
cigars, and watching the graceful involutions
of the clouds he puffed before him, he honestly
believed that he was not wasting his time.
Because he occasionally arrested his wandering
thoughts, and fixed them on his plans for
'Nero,' or for his Comic Opera, he fancied he
was maturing them.  He mistook reveries for
meditation.  And because in those hours of
pensive idleness he made but trifling progress
in the elaboration of his plans, he imagined
that elaboration must necessarily be slow, and
demanded more time.  Thus his very infirmity
was alimented, and each day's error
only made the original mistake more plausible.
</p>

<p>
Who has indulged in all the enchantment of
the world of reverie, wherein materials are so
plastic, and triumphs are so easy,&mdash;when man
seems to be endowed with the god-like privilege
of creation, and his thoughts take shape
without an effort, passing from the creative
mind into the created act, without the hard
obstacle of a medium,&mdash;who is there, I say,
that, having known such intellectual triumph,
has not felt humbled and discouraged when,
descending from the region of reverie and
intention, to that of reality and execution, he has
become aware of the immensity of labour, of
hard resolute labour to be undergone before
he can incarnate his ideas into works?  The
unwritten poems&mdash;the unpainted pictures&mdash;the
unnoted melodies are, it is often said,
transcendantly superior to those poems, pictures, and
melodies which artists succeed in producing.
Perhaps so; but the world justly takes no
account of unaccomplished promises, of unfought
victories.  What it applauds is the actual victory
won in earnest struggle with difficulty; the
heroes it crowns are those who have enriched
them with trophies, not those who might have
done so.
</p>

<p>
But Cecil was content to dream of victory&mdash;to
"dally with the faint surmise" of beauty&mdash;to
plan, to hope, to dream&mdash;but not to act.
He would stand before his easel, looking at his
canvass, or playing listlessly with the colours
on his palette, but never boldly using his
pencil; and because "ideas" did not come to
him in that irresolute mood, he threw the
palette down, lighted a cigar, and declared
himself unfit for work that day.
</p>

<p>
He then would seat himself at the piano to
try if Euterpe were more propitious.  His
fingers running over the keys would naturally
suggest to him some melody that he liked; it
was played, of course, or a fragment of it&mdash;then
another fragment; then he began to sing&mdash;his
voice was good, and it pleased him to hear it.
In this way another hour or so would pass, and
he would then take up his hat and stroll out.
Day after day was this miserable farce of
"awaiting inspiration" played with the same
success.
</p>

<p>
Enthusiastic artists and critics will assuredly
award him their esteem, and proclaim him a
genuine artist&mdash;a real genius&mdash;when they hear
that Cecil had a profound contempt for
"mechanical fellows," who sat down to their work
whether under "inspiration," or under the
mere impulse to finish what they have begun.
He was really eloquent in his scorn of the
"drudges."  Genius, in his eyes, was a divine
caprice.  It came and went in moments of
excitement: a sort of intermittent phrenzy.
Being a scholar, he entirely approved of
Plato's theory to that effect, as developed in
the dialogue of <i>Ion</i>.  The business of an artist
was consequently to await those moments, and
then to set himself to work, when his soul was
stung to ecstacy by overpowering visions of
beauty.
</p>

<p>
There is, in the present day, an overplus of
raving about genius, and its prescriptive rights
of vagabondage, its irresponsibility, and its
insubordination to all the laws of common
sense.  Common sense is so prosaic!  Yet it
appears from the history of art that the real
men of genius did not rave about anything of
the kind.  They were resolute workers, not
idle dreamers.  They knew that their genius
was not a phrenzy, not a supernatural thing at
all, but simply the colossal proportions of
faculties which in a lesser degree, the meanest
of mankind shared with them.  They knew
that whatever it was, it would not enable them
to accomplish with success the things they
undertook, unless they devoted their whole
energies to the task.
</p>

<p>
Would Michael Angelo have built St. Peter's,
sculptured the Moses, and made the walls of
the Vatican sacred with the presence of his
gigantic pencil, had he awaited inspiration
while his works were in progress.  Would
Rubens have dazzled all the galleries of Europe,
had he allowed his brush to hesitate? would
Beethoven and Mozart have poured out their
souls into such abundant melodies? would
Göthe have written the sixty volumes of his
works,&mdash;had they not often, very often, sat down
like drudges to an unwilling task, and found
themselves speedily engrossed with that to
which they were so averse?
</p>

<p>
"Use the pen," says a thoughtful and subtle
author, "there is no magic in it; <i>but it keeps
the mind from staggering about!</i>"*  This is an
aphorism which should be printed in letters of
gold over the studio door of every artist.  Use
the pen or the brush; do not pause, do not
trifle, have no misgivings; but keep your mind
from staggering about by fixing it resolutely
on the matter before you, and then all that
you can do you will do: inspiration will not
enable you to do more.  Write or paint: act,
do not hesitate.  If what you have written or
painted should turn out imperfect, you can
correct it, and the correction will be more
efficient than that correction which takes place
in the shifting thoughts of hesitation.  You
will learn from your failures infinitely more
than from the vague wandering reflections of
a mind loosened from its moorings; because
the failure is absolute, it is precise, it stands
bodily before you, your eyes and judgment
cannot be juggled with, you know whether a
certain verse is harmonious, whether the rhyme
is there or not there; but in the other case
you not only can juggle with yourself but do
so, the very indeterminateness of your thoughts
makes you do so; as long as the idea is not
positively clothed in its artistic form, it is
impossible accurately to say what it will be.
The magic of the pen lies in the concentration
of your thoughts upon one object.  Let your
pen fall, begin to trifle with blotting-paper,
look at the ceiling, bite your nails, and
otherwise dally with your purpose, and you waste
your time, scatter your thoughts, and repress
the nervous energy necessary for your task.
Some men dally and dally, hesitate and trifle
until the last possible moment, and when the
printer's boy is knocking at the door, they
begin: necessity goading them, they write
with singular rapidity, and with singular
success; they are astonished at themselves.  What
is the secret?  Simply this; they have had no
time to hesitate.  Concentrating their powers
upon the one object before them, they have
done what they <i>could</i> do.

CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
A SKETCH OF FRANK FORRESTER.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  These are the arts, Lothario, which shrink acres<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Cecil was rattling away on his piano one
afternoon, fancying he was composing, when
the door opened, and in walked a gentleman
enveloped in a pea-coat, whom Cecil saluted
warmly as Frank Forrester; and after endless
questions and vociferous laughter on both
sides, they both sat down to indulge in rapid
biographical reminiscences from the time of
their last meeting.
</p>

<p>
Frank Forrester was, in every sense of the
word, a man about town.  He was tall and
well-made, and when young must have been
handsome.  Although not yet forty, he looked
much older, from the effects of constant
debauchery.  You could not look at him
without misgivings.  His well-shaped head was
bald from the forehead to the crown, and this
baldness he vainly endeavoured to conceal by
carefully combing the thin long hair over it
which grew at the sides, and which he allowed
to grow very long for that purpose.  I don't
know why, but there is always something
particularly unpleasant in this endeavour to
conceal baldness: it is a subterfuge which
deceives no one, but which is resented as an
attempt to deceive.  In Forrester's case,
perhaps, there was mingled a disagreeable
conviction that he was too young to be bald in
the ordinary course of things; and those thin
straggling hairs were all that had withstood
the midnight fevers and the morning headaches
of his reckless life.  His deep-lined
brow and finely arched eyebrows surmounted
two light greenish-grey eyes, not unlike those
of a fox in expression.  A dark rim, encircling
those eyes, spoke plainly in confirmation of
the bald head, and was further strengthened
by the sallow complexion, stained by a hundred
orgies.  His mouth was large, (the upper
lip adorned with a manly moustache carefully
trimmed and combed,) and displayed teeth
which a shark might not have disowned.
His nose was high and haughty&mdash;curved like
those of the race of Israel&mdash;a nose that
commanded the other features, and which sounded
like a trumpet when he blew it.
</p>

<p>
He was dressed in a style, which, though
heterogeneous in its details, had a certain
homogeneity of effect.  A black-satin stock,
the falls of which were united by two enormous
turquoise pins chained together; a blue
pea-jacket, such as only sailors formerly permitted
themselves, covered his frock-coat.  Very
staring plaid trousers, cut gaiter-wise, to fit
tight over the instep of his <i>bottes vernies</i>,
completed his attire, if we add yellow kid gloves,
and a resplendent gold and crystal mounted
cane made out of the sword of a sword-fish.
This somewhat slang costume was worn in
such a manner that it did not seem slang.
Forrester had the "air of a gentleman,"
which carried off more perilous things than
his costume.  He looked, indeed, something
of a blackleg; but it was the nobleman turned
blackleg.
</p>

<p>
Frank Forrester was not exactly a leg, he
was rather a sponge.  Not over scrupulous in
borrowing money, he never directly cheated.
To ask for a cool hundred which he was certain
of never repaying, which, indeed, he never
intended to repay, was not in his eyes
dishonourable; but to cheat at cards or dice was
a crime with which he had never even sullied
his imagination.  The son of an undertaker,
well to do in the world, he had been brought
up as most boys are brought up, with a slight
infusion of religion administered in weekly
doses, and a wavering code of ethics
enunciated and illustrated in a random and
somewhat contradictory manner.  When his father
died he found himself at the head of a thriving
business which he detested, and in possession
of a good round sum of money, which he did
not class in the same category as the business.
Gifted with a jovial and genial humour, great
animal spirits, and the audacity of a <i>parvenu</i>,
he very quickly "realized," <i>i.e.</i> disposed of
the business, and began his merry career.
While he was spending his money he made
some acquaintances, and learned some experience,
which enabled him, when all was spent,
to turn his acquisitions to advantage, and
make them support him.  Like the noble
spendthrift turned blackleg, he lost a fortune
in acquiring the dexterity to gain one; or,
rather, learned from those who sponged upon
him how he could sponge on others.
</p>

<p>
Never was there a more agreeable sponge,
and no wonder that affluent greenhorns,
desirous of "seeing life," should be glad to see it
under his auspices and in his company.  It could
not be too highly paid.  It was well worth the
champagne and cool hundred.  If a young
booby must squander away the hard-won earnings
of a careful father, it was right, Frank said,
that he should have some pleasure for his money,
and how was that pleasure to be obtained?  By
money?  Not a bit of it!  By science; and he,
Frank, understood the science of spending, and
"flattered himself that he did know how to
make the hours roll swiftly and smoothly,
provided any one were ready to grease the wheels."
</p>

<p>
Frank knew everything, and could do everything,
that a man about town is expected to
know or do.  He was unequalled at billiards,
strong at whist and écarté, adroit at hazard,
great in culinary and cellar knowledge, knew
London as well as his alphabet, and, as he
expressed it, could give the most knowing "a
wrinkle or two on some point or other."
</p>

<p>
One of his "wrinkles" is worth specifying.
He was the first who ever got into parliament
by the simple and ingenious procedure which
has since had several imitators.  He stood for
a borough (which, for weighty reasons, shall
be nameless), where he was an utter stranger.
It was one of those admirable boroughs where
the workings of our electioneering system
are shown to perfection, since almost every
voter had his price.  So notoriously corrupt
was it, that one of the candidates unblushingly
announced on his placards:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "<i>Electors!  Remember this: those who vote for<br>
  * * * will not go unrewarded!</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was a compact little borough, purchaseable
at a price not difficult to calculate.  The
astonishment of Frank Forrester's friends,
when they heard of his standing for * * * may
be conceived.  He replied that he was sure
patriotism, pure unmixed British independence,
was the thing voters wished for now-a-days.
His placards were flaming with splendid
sentences.  His speeches were worthy of Cato of
Utica.  Not a man did he bribe; not a drop
of beer did he allow.
</p>

<p>
"Lor, sir!" said an independent voter to
him, "it's no use your standing if so be you're
not good for a drop o' drink.  We always
expects a little, 'lectioneering time."
</p>

<p>
"My good friend," replied Frank, drawing
himself up, magnificent in virtue, "you have
utterly mistaken me.  I scorn to influence any
one.  If my principles do not speak for me, I
am content to be rejected.  If the voters are
desirous of having a real representative&mdash;one
who reflects their passions, echoes their
prejudices, advocates their interests, and argues
their causes&mdash;I am the man.  If they want
one who will buy their votes&mdash;whose hold is
not on their convictions, but on their cupidity,
I am not&mdash;I say emphatically, I am not their
man!"
</p>

<p>
The baffled voter shook his head dubiously,
and muttered, "Well, well, it won't do, it
won't do!"
</p>

<p>
"It shall do!" majestically retorted Frank.
</p>

<p>
And it came to pass as the voter said, and as
Frank said.
</p>

<p>
The returning officer announced that Frank
Forrester, Esq., had obtained eleven votes.
</p>

<p>
"Electors!" said Frank, with imperturbable
gravity, "I thank you for the confidence you
have displayed.&mdash;(<i>A laugh.</i>)  I repeat it&mdash;I
thank you!  You have returned my rival, and
by an overwhelming majority&mdash;I hope your
confidence there has not been misplaced.  For
myself, I still cherish the hope of one day
representing you.&mdash;(<i>Hear! hear!</i> and cries of
<i>Try the tin next time!</i>)  Upon what do I found
that hope?  Upon the sincerity of my
principles!  You have witnessed how little I
attempted to cajole or bribe you.&mdash;(<i>More fool
you!</i> shouted several.)  I have bought no
man's vote.&mdash;(<i>Howls of contempt.</i>)  Yet you have
unsought, unbought, given me eleven votes.
Electors! on those eleven votes I build my
hope&mdash;I may say, my certainty&mdash;of representing
you.  This imposing minority suffices my
ambition."
</p>

<p>
Only the eleven voters, to whom he had
communicated his plan of action, and one or
two of his special friends, appreciated the
irony which was concealed by the magnificent
buffoonery of this address.  But the mystery
was soon revealed.  Frank petitioned against
his antagonist's return.  The upshot was, that
the liberal briber &mdash;&mdash; was convicted of
corruption, his election annulled, and Frank, on
the shoulders of his "imposing minority," was
carried into parliament.
</p>

<p>
Frank Forrester, as an M.P., was the
torment of the whigs, who were never sure of
his vote.  Although, therefore, his name is
not to be found in Hansard; although he
neither made a motion, nor seconded one
during the whole of his parliamentary career;
times were so "ticklish," that his vote was of
importance, and he made the most of it by
never absenting himself from a division, and
by the impossibility of parties calculating
on which side he would vote.  This power
he converted into patronage, and many were
the little clerkships and small situations which
he was enabled to bestow on deserving young
men; whether he was actuated by pure
philanthropy towards the young men, or by a
desire for the establishment of closer
commercial relations with their parents, he never
disclosed; but it was observable that the
young men had invariably substantial ready
money fathers, and that Frank was invariably
more assiduous at chicken-hazard after those
acts of well-timed patronage.
</p>

<p>
Frank belonged to a stylish club, and had
a numerous set of acquaintances; but they
were almost exclusively males.  A good fellow&mdash;a
jolly dog&mdash;a knowing card&mdash;and a loose
fish: those were the appellatives by which he
was usually distinguished.  He lived upon
confiding young men, and an occasional turn
of the wheel of fortune.  He had always some
new acquaintance&mdash;or rather, let me say, some
inseparable friend, whom he introduced into
the glories and pleasures of "life."  This
friendship was inviolable as long as the young
man's property lasted; but as soon as the
silly gull began to request repayment of loans,
or to lower himself in his patron's eyes, by
retrenchment of his expenditure, then Frank
was either called away from London for a
few weeks, or discovered some splendid young
fellow who really never allowed him a moment's
leisure.  Frank seldom quarrelled with
his victims&mdash;he wanted heartlessness for that:
and he never "cut" them.
</p>

<p>
Frank had "formed" Cecil, and as, when
completely formed, Cecil had gone abroad,
leaving Frank with a richer pupil, no shadow
had darkened their friendship; and on Cecil's
return, he found the same jovial hearty manner,
in spite of his dilapidated means.  This
convinced him of Frank's regard, and from that
moment he had made him the chosen
confidant of all his schemes.

<br><br>
CECIL'S FIRST FALSE STEP.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
No man can be a great enemy, but under the name of a
friend; if you are a cuckold, it is your friend only that makes
you so, for your enemy is not admitted to your house; if you
are cheated in your fortune, 'tis your friend that does it, for
your enemy is not made your trustee; if your honour or good
name is injured, 'tis your friend that does it still, for your
enemy is not believed against you.
</p>

<p class="intro">
WYCHERLEY.&mdash;<i>Plain Dealer.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Well, Frank, and how goes the world with
<i>you</i>?" said Cecil, after having made him
acquainted with the present state of his affairs.
</p>

<p>
"Tollollish!" replied Frank.  "I have an
ingenious youth in training, who, I am sorry to
say, is nearly trained or drained.  Picked him
up abroad&mdash;genus snob, very distinct!  But
snob's money I find quite as available as any
other.  I was going from Verviers to Cologne
this summer, when in the deserted first-class
carriage into which I ensconced myself, there
stepped a flaxen-haired youth, of the unmistakeable
"gent" style&mdash;the only real substitute
for a "gentleman."  He was soon after followed
by a lathy boy, all skin and bone, with trousers
either shrunk by washing, or considerably
outgrown, and fastened with <i>immeasureable straps</i>.
The swagger of this boy was worth money to
see.  He entered into familiar conversation at
once, and favoured me with some biographical
particulars, which were eminently trivial.  At
last he took out his cigar-case, and offering it
to me, with an air of exquisite assumption
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Do you do anything in this way?"
</p>

<p>
"Not so early in the day."
</p>

<p>
"Lord, it doesn't matter to me what's the
time o' day, I'm always ready to blow a cloud,
I can tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," said I, with perfect gravity.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  Do try one.  I dare say it won't
disagree with you.  It's all fancy."
</p>

<p>
"You seem to be a fast fellow."
</p>

<p>
"I believe you."
</p>

<p>
"Do you come from London?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I'm a Southampton boy.  We do it
in prime style there, I can tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you do?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't we, that's all!"
</p>

<p>
"Were those trousers built in Southampton?&mdash;they're
devilish stylish&mdash;so uncommon, too!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied the innocent youth, in all the
verdure of his nature.  "Yes, they were built
at Southampton&mdash;but I don't call <i>them</i>
anything&mdash;merely put on to travel in&mdash;you should see
my fawn kerseys and my plaids!"
</p>

<p>
"What, better cut?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no comparison."
</p>

<p>
"I should like very much to have your
Schneider's address.  I am going to Southampton
on my return to England.  I suppose
if I were to mention your name&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Lord, yes, that would be sure to do it.  But
he isn't a cheap tailor, mind you."
</p>

<p>
The "gent" was leaning his head out of
window, nearly suffocated with suppressed
laughter, and from time to time encouraging
me with fierce winks to proceed.
</p>

<p>
"There," said my lathy patron, "I have
written his address on one of my cards&mdash;just
show him my name, and you'll find it all
right."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, sir," I asked, as if suddenly eager in
poultry, "when you left Southampton, what
was the price of a young goose?"
</p>

<p>
This was too much for the "gent," who
burst out into a fit of uncontrollable laughter.
The viridity of the Southampton youth was
great, but this laughter opened his eyes.  He
coloured, and exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you want to chaff, do you?  But it
won't do.  I sha'n't bite.  I'm not such a fool
as I look."
</p>

<p>
"That's <i>very</i> possible&mdash;Heaven forbid you
should be!" said I; whereupon a fresh burst of
laughter from snob primus, who vowed that the
youth was "sold."
</p>

<p>
At the next station, <i>lath</i> left our carriage;
and "gent" instantly began expressing to me
his delight at the way I had "sold the snob;"
which led to his becoming in turn communicative,
and informing me that he had just
"sacked a little tin," which it was his intention
"to spend like a brick."  From that moment I
took him into my confidence.  I have trained
him.  I have taught him how to dine&mdash;which
he had once imagined consisted in eating what
money could procure.  I have taught him to
live.  He is no longer a snob; at least, he
doesn't betray himself.  But&mdash;and, damn my
whiskers! this is the sad part of the business&mdash;it
is the way with so many of them&mdash;now, just
as he is becoming companionable, his purse is
running low."
</p>

<p>
Frank sighed as he thus finished his tale, but
quickly changing the subject, he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Come, let's take a turn, and look in at the
club."
</p>

<p>
"No, Frank, I must work."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!  What's the use of puddling all
day over your work&mdash;you only stupify yourself.
Come."
</p>

<p>
"There's some truth in what you say, I
believe; the brain gets muddled by long
application.  Yet my picture isn't half finished
yet&mdash;half!&mdash;not a quarter."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind; leave it for to-day.  Damn
my whiskers!  I must have you to-day."
</p>

<p>
Cecil's irresolution was soon conquered; he
took his hat, and went out with his chum.
They strolled down to the club, where Cecil
had not shown himself since his marriage.  The
heartiness of his welcome greatly flattered him;
he felt that he was a favourite; success cheered
him; his spirits rose; he became unusually
brilliant.
</p>

<p>
"You must dine with us to-day, Cis," said
Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible, my dear fellow."
</p>

<p>
"Don't know the word, Cis.  I have said
you dine with us&mdash;four&mdash;jolly party; and you
dine: damn my whiskers!"
</p>

<p>
"But my wife&mdash;&mdash;."
</p>

<p>
"Well?  Inestimable Benedict, you are not
tied to her apron-string, are you?  You have
not submitted to the tyranny of the weaker
sex?  You are master?"
</p>

<p>
"I am; certainly I am; but&mdash;&mdash;."
</p>

<p>
"You have never dined from home before.
You shake your head.  Very well, now is the
time to begin."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Frank, you must know me well
enough to know that I should have no scruple
in following my own wishes; and although I
have not yet dined from home, I have no sort
of fear that when I choose to do it, my wife
will make a remark.  But in the present case
she will be alarmed&mdash;she has no idea of my
coming down here.  My hours have been very
regular, and if I were not to present myself at
five o'clock, she would be seriously concerned
about me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, it's always by that unnecessary
'concern' that women begin.  What the devil
is there to be concerned about?  The sooner
you accustom her to the accidents of life&mdash;to
the impromptu parties and unexpected
absences&mdash;the smoother will your life be."
</p>

<p>
"When you are married, Frank, you can
manage as you please, but for me your system
won't do.  I love my wife, and my constant
care is to make her happy."
</p>

<p>
Frank looked at him with an indescribable
mixture of astonishment, incredulity, and pity;
then, as a thought seemed to occur to him
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"But look here, Cis, the thing is easy.  Just
scribble a line to tell her not to expect you,
that you are dining at the club, and one of
the men shall take it.  Will that satisfy you?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly."
</p>

<p>
"Then do it."
</p>

<p>
Cecil wrote thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"MY OWN SWEET PET!
</p>

<p>
"Do not wait dinner for me to-day, as I
am forced to dine with some influential people
at the club.  But I shall hurry away as soon
as possible, and be with you before ten.  A
hundred kisses.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"CECIL."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The dinner was excellent, and the guests in
high spirits.  The "influential people" of
whom Cecil spoke, were the great Frank
himself, young Hudson (the youth in training and
the amphytrion), and Tom Chetsom, jolly Tom
Chetsom.  The wines were not spared; and
by the time the smoking-room was sought for
a quiet cigar and cup of coffee, to assist the
slow elaborate digestion of those who had
dined well, Cecil was in that peculiar state
which I would christen moral drunkenness.
He was not tipsy: nor near it.  His walk was
as steady, his eye as free in its movements, his
vision as undisturbed as before dinner.  But
although neither in his gait nor conversation
he betrayed the least influence of wine, yet
within he felt a sort of torpor&mdash;the strong
desire for a sensation which makes men reckless
how they procure it, and which makes them
passively adopt any plan likely to arouse them
from the heavy deadening lethargy in which
their faculties are enveloped.
</p>

<p>
The smoking-room soon became intolerable
to him.  He wanted movement&mdash;excitement.
The theatre was proposed.  They went.  But
the heat, the glare of the lights, the dazzle, and
confusion of the whole place, made Cecil
worse.  They left the house.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do?" said jolly Tom
Chetsom, as they stood under the portico of Drury-lane.
</p>

<p>
Hudson proposed the Coal-Hole; but Frank
reminding him that it was too early, he was
distinctly of opinion that he should not go
home till morning, till daylight did appear.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you what, Tom," said Frank, "isn't
it one of Hester's soirées to-night?  Suppose
we go there: she'll be charmed to know Cis&mdash;he's
half a literary man, and wholly a painter."
</p>

<p>
"Good idea!" said Tom.  "Will you go,
Chamberlayne?"
</p>

<p>
"Anywhere.  Let's start."
</p>

<p>
"Come along, then."
</p>

<p>
And they drove to Cadogan-place.

<p>
While they are driving to Cadogan-place, let
us cast a retrospective glance at the fortunes
of the authoress of <i>Gleams and Glooms</i>, to
whose soirée they are wending.
</p>

<p>
Hester Mason had achieved a part of her
ambition: she held a salon in London.  How
she contrived and maintained that, would take
long to narrate in detail, as it was only by
steady perseverance and admirable ingenuity
she succeeded.  On first eloping with Sir
Chetsom, she had the tact never once to
mention a settlement; indeed when he, in a
moment of tenderness, alluded to the subject, she
playfully put her hand upon his mouth and
said,&mdash;"Oh, don't begin to talk of money, or
I shall think you have <i>bought</i> me.  You are
not going to leave me, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Leave you, Hester?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, leave me.  It looks like it.  I am
poor I know; but rich in <i>your love</i>.  Make me
independent, and you will think it no hardship
for me to be left; it is always so with men!"
</p>

<p>
A sigh followed this.  Sir Chetsom was
ravished; the dupe was fooled to the top of
his bent.  Hester marked the effect, and from
that moment knew her power.  From that
moment he denied her nothing.  The time
would come, she foresaw, when he would be
completely her slave, and that was the time to
make conditions.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, she impressed him with the
notion of the necessity for their <i>liaison</i> being
hidden from the world.  If people did not
respect her, they would not envy him.  If she
were not something more than his mistress, he
would be not better than the common herd of
men who have their "follies."  Appearances
should be preserved for all sakes.  Sir Chetsom
admitted the truth of this, reserving to
himself the privilege of disclosing his secret at
the club, by intelligible hints and half-confidences.
</p>

<p>
He had given her a house; he had brought
there the nucleus of a literary and artistic
society.  Hester received every Wednesday
evening, and as her parties had a certain
piquancy, they were well attended.  The great
difficulty was to get women.  That is always
the stumbling-block of an equivocal position.
Men are willing enough to go anywhere, if
they are amused, and to ask no questions, or
at least to affect no prudery.  With women,
the case is wholly different.  Accordingly,
with what untiring perseverance do women in
equivocal positions manœuvre to obtain the
presence of virtuous women at their houses!
How they pet them, how full of delicate attentions
and substantial kindness!  What cajoleries,
what adroit insinuations, what flattering
prospects they set forth to dazzle their "dear
friends"!  What twaddle they will listen to
for hours, with the eagerness of curious
interest; what confidences accept!  It is one of
the most amusing scenes in the comedy of
society to witness the grateful attentions of a
woman who is not "received," to those of her
female acquaintance who shut their eyes to her
real position, or are ignorant of it.  You see
a pretty, lively, clever, graceful, dashing
woman of the world exerting all her coquetries
to cajole some ugly, stupid, awkward, under-bred
woman whose "countenance" she wants.
She imagines that the presence of a few
"modest women," no matter what their unattractiveness,
will give her salon an air <i>comme il
faut</i>.  But it deceives no one.  It only renders
her salon a little less agreeable.
</p>

<p>
Hester managed, as others manage, to collect
a few complaisant woman, and a man or
two old enough, stupid enough, and
respectable enough to keep them in countenance;
and she had a salon.
</p>

<p>
Sir Chetsom Chetsom was rich and lavish.
Without asking for it, Hester contrived to
have almost everything she wished for.  His
vanity, at first only tickled by the conquest,
was now always alive to the maintenance of
that conquest.  She made him feel that his
position was insecure: it was done delicately,
but it was done.  To the dread of being left by
her in favour of another, was soon added the
dread of losing her for her own sake.  He had
become accustomed to her.  She amused him,
occupied him, captivated him.  When she
pouted, he was in despair; when she caressed
him, he was in raptures.  The old boy was
alternately alarmed at her perception of the
difference in their ages, and flattered at the
conviction that, in spite of that difference, she
really loved him.  She was always playing
upon two themes.  First theme.&mdash;Why should
I waste my youth and love upon a selfish old
monster?  Second theme.&mdash;How infinitely
preferable is the love of a man who has seen
the world, and lost the first illusions of youth,
to the capricious tenderness of a boy!
</p>

<p>
Give those themes to a clever woman, and
imagine the variations she would play upon
them!
</p>

<p>
Although Hester had achieved a part of her
ambitious plans, it must not be supposed that
she was either satisfied or happy.  She had
kicked the dust of Walton from her feet.  She
was in the capital, and surrounded by luxury.
She had a salon to which many celebrities
were visitors.  But neither Sir Chetsom nor
her visitors could make <i>Gleams and Glooms</i>
popular.  Not a copy was sold.  Not a journal
of any standing took the least notice of it.
Some exaggerated criticisms, bristling with
notes of admiration, and sonorous with epithets
of praise, did indeed appear; but they
appeared in journals of no character, and bore
the evident stamp of the puff direct.  She
sent a copy, with a flattering letter, to every
author whose name rose above the herd into
some distinction.  From the majority, she
received no acknowledgment; from a great
many came letters instantaneously acknowledging
the "receipt" of the volume, but not
a word on its contents; from some few poets
she received general and vague flatteries,
together with copies "from the authors" of
their last new poems.  A delicate attention,
expressive of this golden rule&mdash;praise me and
I'll praise you.
</p>

<p>
Having consoled herself with the conviction
that the age was a prosaic age averse to poetry,
she began a novel, hoping to gain celebrity by
that.
</p>

<p>
In noting the latent causes of her dissatisfaction,
I have said nothing of Sir Chetsom.
That she was not happy, while forced to act
the degrading character of mistress to such a
man, will be understood; she used him as
the ladder by which to ascend the height
which beckoned in the distance; but she
thoroughly despised him, and at times
despised herself.
</p>

<p>
On the Wednesday evening chosen by Frank
Forrester for the introduction of Cecil to the
fair muse, Hester was looking particularly
well.  A flush of animation gave a tint to
her cheek, and additional fire to her dark eyes.
In her raven hair a string of costly pearls were
woven; large glittering bracelets encircled her
well-shaped arms; and a black velvet dress
set off to perfection her handsome bust, which
was lavishly displayed.  She was seated on
the sofa propounding some humanitarian
doctrine, when the four were announced.  She
rose graciously.  Tom Chetsom apologized for
the liberty he had taken in bringing
Mr. Chamberlayne, who was very desirous of the
honour, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
"Any friend of yours will always be welcome,
Mr. Chetsom," she said, smiling, "and
Mr. Chamberlayne particularly so.  I have
often heard his name, and always accompanied
by some flattering epithet."
</p>

<p>
Cecil bowed.
</p>

<p>
Frank then presented Hudson, and Cecil
noticed, that although she also received him
with a gracious smile, there was a marked
difference in her manner.  Strange animals
that we are! this flattered him exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
The rooms were full; and conversation was
lively in groups.  It was a curious assembly
when the details were examined, and had little
of that éclat which Hester had imagined in her
dreams.  The men for the most part were
neither young nor aristocratic; they were&mdash;at
least some of them&mdash;not positively unknown
to fame; small reputations, current only in
literary circles&mdash;scarcely heard beyond those
circles; men of talent, men of worth, men of
energy and of ambition, but scarcely at ease in
society.  Mixed with these were a few of Sir
Chetsom's club-men, a few harmless
respectabilities, and a few&mdash;very few women.
</p>

<p>
One of these women was requested to oblige
with one of her charming performances, and her
harp was wheeled into the centre of the room.
It is one of the penalties attached to the
condition of such women as Hester, that if their
dear female friends have any little accomplishment,
they must be implored to exhibit it.
In any other society, Miss Blundell would no
more have been asked to perform, than Gunter's
waiters would be asked to dance.  But
to secure Miss Blundell, Hester could not
avoid inviting her to play.  If Hester wanted
countenance, Miss Blundell wanted admiration.
And it was really comic to see the mistress
of the house threading the crowd of
visitors, and entreating their attention to the
fantasia with which Miss Blundell was about
to favour them.
</p>

<p>
The hubbub of conversation was almost
stilled, and Miss Blundell advanced to take
possession of her harp.
</p>

<p>
"She's ugly enough for a genius," whispered
Frank to Hester.  Hester put her finger
on her lip to command his silence.
</p>

<p>
Frank's observation was just.  Miss Blundell
was not handsome.  Of an age so uncertain
that it is denominated a "certain age,"
she wore her black hair in a girlish crop.
On a low, square, rugged forehead sparkled a
<i>Sévigné</i>.  Wondering eyebrows overarched two
sunken eyes; a graceless nose and insignificant
mouth did <i>not</i> tempt an artist to fix them
on his canvass.  In accordance with the
juvenility of her style, she was robed in white
muslin, displaying a scraggy tawny neck,
fierce and protuberant shoulder-blades, and
disreputable arms.  Certainly nothing but great
skill could exonerate such ugliness.
</p>

<p>
She began by a rattling sweep over the
strings, and an audacious display of elbows.
Having thus fixed attention, she paused and
sought inspiration from the ceiling.  Genius
always does.  I know not what mystic
influence there may be in a white-washed
<i>plafond</i>; but it appears there is something of the
kind, since rhymes, tropes, and melodies are
drawn therefrom.  Miss Blundell found music
there.  A few seconds of silent invocation
brought down the muse, and she flogged the
harp into the Gustavus galop.
</p>

<p>
There are players of no feeling, and players
of too much feeling.  Miss Blundell was of
the latter class.  She despised execution (with
some private reasons for so doing), and thought
music should have a soul.  Feeling was all
in all with her, and feeling she threw into
everything.  Even this mad, giggling, joyous,
whirling, rattling galop was not free from
her sentimental caprice.  She began <i>con spirito</i>,&mdash;

<p class="noindent">
which suddenly changed, at the fourth bar,
from <i>allegro vivace</i> to an <i>ad libitum rallentando</i>,
expressive of the deepest emotion, the player's
eyes thrown upwards as if in rapt devotion.
These notes,

<p class="noindent">
died away in a "billowy ecstacy of woe,"
immediately succeeded by a fiery <i>allegro</i>, which
again subsided into a pathetic <i>rallentando</i>:

<a id="img-207c"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-207c.jpg" alt="music fragment">
</p>

<p class="noindent">
An ironical murmur of applause followed this
display, and Hester pressed her hand as she
thanked, complimented, and led her back
again to the sofa.
</p>

<p>
"Was it not charming?" she asked Frank,
in a tone intentionally audible.
</p>

<p>
"Amazing!" replied he; then adding, in an
under tone, "she is the Orpheus of private
life: as witness the effect she produces on the
animals here.  I hope she hasn't turned the
cream."'
</p>

<p>
"You are a sad man&mdash;so satirical!"
</p>

<p>
"Not I.  Your friend delights me; she's
original."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am no musician myself; but I
believe she is."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, as cats are musicians."
</p>

<p>
Hester laughed, and turned to Cecil; but
Frank instantly recalled her attention, by
saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Do tell me who is that old buffer leaning
against the mantelpiece.  Is it Miss Blundell's
brother?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Of course&mdash;I knew it&mdash;he <i>could</i> be nobody
else's brother.  Do study him.  He'll
do for your novel.  Look at him, Cis.
Observe that blue coat, is it not immeasurably,
audaciously, sublimely impossible!  The short
waist, the large collar, like a horse-collar,
the brass buttons, and scanty skirt!  When was
it made?  In what dim remoteness of the
mythic ages was it conceived and executed?
What primitive and most ancient Briton first
wore it?  By Jove! I must ask the address
of his tailor."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Frank, for God's sake, don't."
</p>

<p>
"Then the flaming shawl-waistcoat, the
grey trousers strapped so tightly over those
big many-bunioned feet, the eye-glass, the
flower in his button-hole, the withered smiling
face, the jaunty juvenility of this most withered
individual!  Really, Miss Mason, you ought to
make a collection from us all, for the privilege
of seeing this unedited burlesque, this fabulous
curiosity!  He is a mummy unembalmed!"
</p>

<p>
The drollery of Frank's manner was irresistible,
and both Hester and Cecil were bursting
with laughter, when the unconscious object
approached them, and asked Hester whether
some one else would not add to the harmony
of the evening.
</p>

<p>
"I am quite sure," he added, with a gallant
bow, "that to your numerous accomplishments
you add the gift of song."
</p>

<p>
Hester excused herself.
</p>

<p>
"You look like a singer," said Frank to
him with perfect gravity.  "I see it in your
manner.  Is it not so?"
</p>

<p>
A withered smile and feeble shake of the
head was Mr. Blundell's answer.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, I suppose all the musical
genius of the family is centred in your
charming sister.  What a player!  What a
touch&mdash;or rather what a pull!"
</p>

<p>
"Humph! yes, not bad."
</p>

<p>
"So much feeling!  Feeling is the thing,
sir.  It is soul, passion, poetry.  Feeling's
the chap for me!  A poet, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"You look like one."
</p>

<p>
"No; I am merely a dabbler.  I follow in
the wake of intellectual men.  I have some
humour.  My friends think me a sort of 'Boz'&mdash;that
certainly is my line.  But I have no
pretensions."
</p>

<p>
"Have you written much?"
</p>

<p>
"A good deal.  I have written for 'Blackwood.'"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but they never printed what I sent
them.  I don't know why.  Perhaps, because
I am not a Scotchman.  They are very jealous
of English writers.  Had I been a Scotchman
they would have jumped at my papers; so my
friends tell me."
</p>

<p>
"The scoundrels!" said Frank; but whether
he meant the Scotchmen, or the friends,
remains undecided.
</p>

<p>
"My friend Mr. Donkin, the celebrated
epic poet, (the author of 'Mount Horeb,' you
know,) thought my papers very funny, very;
but 'Blackwood' actually rejected some
poems of his, as well as a 'Dissertation on the
conditions of the Intellectual Epopæ.'  Do
you write, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; letters."
</p>

<p>
Blundell was puzzled.  He could not from
Frank's manner detect whether this was a
<i>naïveté</i> or a sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
"A very literary employment too," said
Cecil, "according to the landlady of one of
my friends.  He was looking at apartments in
Brighton, and before concluding, he asked his
landlady whether she had other lodgers?
</p>

<p>
"'Only one gentleman, sir,' she said, 'rather
an eccentric gentleman.  I suppose you know
him, sir, it's Mr. Shakspeare.'
</p>

<p>
"'I have not the pleasure of knowing
Mr. Shakspeare.'
</p>

<p>
"'Don't you, sir?  <i>He's the great writer!</i>'
</p>

<p>
"'Ah, the great writer!'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes; but lor, sir, <i>writer as he is</i>, he has only
written two letters all the time he has been in
my house!'
</p>

<p>
Blundell laughed feebly, though a funny
man&mdash;a sort of "Boz" his friends told him;
he did not see the joke, but laughed because
the others laughed.
</p>

<p>
At this moment Sir Chetsom Chetsom was
announced.  "How late you are!" said Hester,
reproachfully; but she paid him no attention
during the rest of the evening, and his
manner to her was eminently respectful.
</p>

<p>
Cecil was amused.  He conversed with
some clever men, and was flattered by his own
success; he was a really good talker, often
brilliant, always amusing.  Hester took a
great fancy to him, and engaged him in several
discussions on rather perilous topics for a
young man and a young woman to discuss.
In them Cecil felt uneasy.  He was not on
equal ground in talking to a young woman,
and although she piqued him to continue, he
felt himself at a disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
"You forget," he said at last, in the midst of an
argument on marriage, "that I am a married
man, and therefore cannot espouse your view."
</p>

<p>
"Truly, but why can you not?  Because
the present odious law of marriage is all in
favour of the men."
</p>

<p>
"I demur to that."
</p>

<p>
"Men make the laws, and make them for
their own advantage.  Think of the gross
injustice!  Women must not only be rigorously pure,
but must even be kept in ignorance as complete
as watchfulness will admit of; but a man
may have had a hundred low amours, and no
father refuses to give him a daughter.  Purity,
which is supposed to be woman's greatest
virtue, is never thought of in a man.  Why
should not a girl demand that her lover
be as pure as herself?  Why should woman
be hopelessly disgraced for that which in a
man is venial?  I know what you will say;
but I repeat that marriage is an unholy
institution.  Think of the suicides committed by
women who have been seduced; did you ever
hear of the seducer shooting himself?  Think
of the wretched wives who have died broken-hearted,
of the outcasts of society&mdash;outcasts
for that which disgraces no man.  What is it
all owing to? the law of marriage!  Beside
the fearful crimes and desperate acts which
the law of marriage causes, look at the
thousands of young, healthy, affectionate girls,
who wither in unblessed virginity, who never
know the joys of maternity.  And mark the
glorious inconsistency of men: you keep us
ignorant, you keep us from equal privileges,
you shut us from the world of action, and your
sole argument for it is, that nature has unfitted
us for it; that we are inferior creatures, whose
organization is specially adapted to the bearing,
rearing, and nursing of children; yet this,
for which alone we were created, your barbarous
law of marriage denies to a frightful number;
wretched girls who wither in the hope of
finding husbands."
</p>

<p>
"That the law of marriage," answered
Cecil, "transmutes a desire into a crime is
very true.  But the law of property is open
to the same objection.  A man covets your
money or your plate; the law of property
forces him either to break into your house,
perhaps to murder you, or to restrain his
desires.  But because men are hanged for
murder, no one really wishes to abolish the
law of property; because men are transported
and imprisoned for frauds and felonies, it is no
argument against a law of property."
</p>

<p>
"That I admit."
</p>

<p>
"Then surely you must admit, that although
the law of marriage may punish those who
infringe its precepts, it is not therefore to be
abolished."
</p>

<p>
"No; but there is this difference: the
principles of justice and moral education may
control the desire of despoiling or defrauding
another of his property, but human passion
owns no such stern control.  Love is beyond
volition.  The husband cannot will to love his
wife, the wife cannot will not to love another.
Reason is powerless against the passion,
because the woman loves before she is aware of
it.  She does not see the danger till she is
enveloped in it.  Marriage is indissoluble, but
passion is capricious.  It is foolish, impious,
for a human being to swear that he will love
another eternally.  Passion in its intensity
always believes in its eternity.  But who can
answer for the continuance of love?  Who
can say, I will not change?  Because we
foresee no change, are we to shut our eyes to
the experience of ages: to our own experience
even, which tells too plainly of the mutability
of passion?  Yet marriage is indissoluble!"
</p>

<p>
"And rightly so," said Cecil, "for this one
reason&mdash;whatever is inevitable soon ceases to
be a hardship; the very power which human
beings have of adapting themselves to almost
any condition, makes them accept their fate
with tranquillity, provided that fate be
certain and unequivocal.  Passion is, as you say,
mutable, capricious.  But in the generality of
cases, the mere consciousness of the indissolubility
of the marriage tie acts as a check upon
the roving fancy."
</p>

<p>
Hester shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"This much I will grant," continued Cecil,
"that as a matter of sentiment, as a mere
question of love, I think you are in the main
correct; but as a matter of practical civilization,
as a civil institution which regards the
whole framework of society, I think
you&mdash;pardon me&mdash;altogether wrong."
</p>

<p>
The clock on the mantelpiece struck one
as he said this, and its sharp, thin note struck
like ice upon his heart, as he remembered
that his beloved Blanche was sitting up
awaiting him, and had been since ten o'clock.
He took a hasty leave of Hester, promising
to renew the conversation some other evening,
and, with a whisper to Frank, withdrew.
</p>

<p>
Hester saw him depart, with a vague feeling
of regret.  To understand this, we must
not only recall the sudden friendship all have
known sometimes to spring up in one evening's
intercourse, but we must also consider
Hester's peculiar position.  She was then just
recovering from the shock her illusions had
sustained with reference to men of genius.  In
her provincial and poetical ignorance, she had
imagined that every man of remarkable powers
must be captivating in appearance.  Apollo
in the shape of Vulcan was a monstrosity
which had never distorted her dreams.  I do
not mean that she supposed every distinguished
poet, novelist, or critic was as handsome
as a guardsman.  She was prepared for
daring oddities of appearance; and was more
likely to be captivated by the "flashing eyes
and floating hair," by the wild irregularities of
an inspired face, than by the lineal correctness
of a beauty man.  But she was prepared to
find singularity and youth: a striking appearance
joined to all the ardour and impetuosity
of youth.  In both was she deceived.  The
men she saw were for the most part undistinguishable
in appearance from the rest of the
world, and when distinguishable, not picturesquely
so.  Above all, they were not young.
</p>

<p>
It is rather curious at first, to one unfamiliar
with the artistic world, to see how little youth
is to be met with amongst the celebrities.
Our young poets are middle-aged men; our
rising authors are bald; our distinguished
painters are passing into the "sere and yellow
leaf;" our <i>very</i> "young Englanders" are
getting gray and pursy.
</p>

<p>
The truth is, life is short and art is long;
and although a privileged man does sometimes
in the ardour of youth reach the summit
of reputation by a bound, either from the
prodigal richness of his genius, or from having
hit the favour of the movement, yet, as a
general rule, celebrity is slowly gained, and
not without many years of toilsome effort.
Mastery requires immense labour.  Before
the proper power over materials can be gained,
the artist must have spent enormous labour;
and before that power can be exerted in any
striking way, the artist must have lived much,
suffered much, and observed much.  Celebrity
is not easily gained now-a-days.  The lavish
abundance of talent daily, weekly, and monthly
squandered upon fugitive productions, makes
it no easy matter to rise above the ordinary
level; while the multiplicity of works so far
exceeds all reading powers to keep pace with
them, that, for an author to gain more than
a limited and temporary reputation, it is
necessary he should either be very lucky, or
very earnest, hard-working, resolute, and
clever.  But before he has attained sufficient
mastery to command respect, the gray hairs
begin to show themselves.  He must have
made many efforts, struck many blows, before
the way is opened to him, before the world
will recognise him.
</p>

<p>
What a shock then to Hester, when she
found, one after the other, all were middle-aged
men.  The ardour and freshness in their
works was but the reminiscence of a youthhood
which required the mastery of manhood
to mould it.  The men she had admired, of
whom she had made idols, when she saw them
as they were, with deep-lined faces, thin hair,
deficient teeth, and all the signs of premature
middle age, created a feeling of disappointment
almost amounting to disgust.  She forgot
that in straining their voices to be heard
above the crowd, they had grown husky by
the time they had succeeded.
</p>

<p>
Cecil was the first young handsome man
whom she had seen, and who, although not
yet known to fame, had a sort of drawing-room
reputation; she was charmed with him;
his wit, vivacity, gentlemanly manner, and
handsome countenance, were all calculated to
make a deep impression upon her.  Without
acknowledging to herself the interest she felt
in him, she allowed her thoughts to dwell
upon what he had said, and how he had
looked, rather more than was safe for her
peace of mind.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
HUSBAND AND WIFE.
</h3>

<p>
When Blanche received Cecil's note, informing
her that he was to dine at the club, she felt
truly glad.  Ill as she could spare his company,
especially in such a house as Mrs. Tring's, she
felt glad.  The good little thing forgot her own
loss in the idea of his pleasure.  She was so
delighted that he was going to enjoy himself
for once among his old friends.  After the
miserable fare of their boarding-house, how
he would relish the cuisine of his club!  He
wanted a little change.  He wanted relaxation:
he overworked himself.
</p>

<p>
This was the way little Blanche accepted her
husband's first absence from home.  I dare say,
thin-lipped madam, you wholly disapprove of
her simplicity; you think she did not
understand men and husbands; that she showed
false generosity.  You would not have taken
it so quietly&mdash;not you!  In her place, you
would at once have seen through the selfishness
and want of attention which permitted
a husband, so newly married, to leave his wife
in that way, and return to his vile bachelor
haunts.  In her place, you would have sat up
for him, cowering under a huge shawl, careful
that the candles should be burnt to the last
inch, you having allowed the fire to go out; and
you would have received him either in the
sullen dignity of silence, or with hot,
fast-falling tears.
</p>

<p>
In her place,&mdash;But Blanche, my dear madam,
had not your thin lips and fretful organization.
She was an innocent, artless, affectionate, little
creature, adoring her husband, believing herself
unworthy of him, and only happy in his happiness.
She lived for him.  If he was happy by
her side, it gave her exquisite delight; if he
was happy, away from her, she felt, indeed, the
void of his absence; but the thought of his
being amused, took from absence its pain.
Jealousy she had none.  Her trusting nature
could not harbour it: certain of his love, to
question it would be profanity.
</p>

<p>
So till ten o'clock she occupied herself
cheerily enough.  After that, she began to
expect him.  Eleven struck.  "He has been
kept later than he intended," she said.
</p>

<p>
A novel was on the table.  She began to
read it.  Cecil's face was constantly dancing
on the page; and, once or twice, when the
author mentioned convivial dinners, she pictured
to herself Cecil surrounded by admirers,
the wine passing freely, no one heeding the
time; and, as the clock struck twelve, she said,
"He is greatly amused."
</p>

<p>
There was something of the sublime devotion
of woman's love in this quiet reflection, which,
as in all generosity, had its own sweet
recompense.  The thought made her happy, and hid
from her the fact that it was twelve o'clock,
and she was waiting for him.
</p>

<p>
She continued her novel.
</p>

<p>
Cecil was hurrying home, very uneasy at
having stayed out so late.  The stupor which
wine had occasioned was quite gone, and he
began to reproach himself for having
accompanied Chetsom to Hester's.  He had never
left Blanche before.  How could she have
passed her evening?  What would her anxiety
be when ten, then eleven, then twelve, then
one o'clock struck, and he not home?  What
excuse should he make?
</p>

<p>
Nothing can better express the difference
between Cecil and Blanche, than these two
thoughts:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He is greatly amused!"
</p>

<p>
"What excuse shall I make?"
</p>

<p>
The confidence and love of the one is not
more distinctly indicated by the first, than the
weakness of the other is by the second.
</p>

<p>
No excuse was needed.  When he arrived
home, instead of reproaches, silent or
expressed, he was met with kisses and joyous
questions.  All she seemed curious about was,
how he had been amused.  For herself, she
had passed the time pleasantly enough.  Her
work and her novel had amused her.  Oh, he
wasn't to think himself of such consequence:
existence was not insupportable without
him&mdash;for a few hours!
</p>

<p>
Cecil took both her hands in his, and,
pressing his lips upon her lovely eyes, felt
deeply, inexpressibly, what a treasure he had
got; but he said nothing; nor was it necessary
to say it.  She understood him.
</p>

<p>
Cecil was careful not to whisper a word of
Hester's equivocal position to Blanche, who
imagined Miss Mason to be some worthy old
maid.
</p>

<p>
On the following Wednesday, Cecil again
went to Hester's, and again spent a pleasant
evening.  He there met some painters, whom
he was desirous to know.  This gave a colouring
of business to his visits&mdash;a pretext to
himself, for Blanche needed none.
</p>

<p>
The more Hester saw of Cecil, the more he
engaged her fancy, and, at last, her affections.
Of this he was wholly unconscious.  His own
love for his wife was an amulet against all
Hester's coquetries.  But although no harm
as yet had come to his affections, through
this acquaintance with Hester, who could say
that it would long continue thus?  Cecil must
discover her affection in time, and then...
</p>

<p>
Yet into this peril did Blanche innocently
urge him.  She knew he was amused there;
she knew he there extended his acquaintance
among artists; and she was happy that he
should take the relaxation of one evening
in the week.
</p>

<p>
The peril was, however, twofold: it was not
only that Cecil should be entangled by
Hester&mdash;that was an uncertainty; it was also&mdash;and
this more certain&mdash;that the poor, struggling
artist, by nature indolent, and by accident now
pampered in his indolence, should, in these
club dinners and conversaziones, once more
have the desire for luxury awakened in him,
and a distaste for his present condition render
it insupportable.
</p>

<p>
This latter peril was perhaps the more
formidable of the two.  Cecil fell into it.
The oftener he went to his club&mdash;he had
never ceased paying his subscription, having
always had the prospect of very soon being
in a condition to belong to a club with
propriety&mdash;the oftener he went there, the greater
his disgust at the gloomy house and niggardly
fare of the home he had chosen.  Unhappily
he could not leave it.  Partly, because his
funds made its cheapness all important; partly,
because he still hoped its beggary would work
upon Meredith Vyner's feelings.

WYCHERLEY.&mdash;<i>The Plain Dealer.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When the Vyners returned to town, and Rose
discovered that Julius was in Italy, the grief
which had assailed her, in the first remorse at
having played with his affection, was crossed
with a certain feeling of indignation at the
calmness, as she called it, with which he
accepted his fate.  This was very unreasonable,
I allow; very.  It was not at all like a
heroine; but it was like a woman, I believe;
and certainly like Rose.
</p>

<p>
For you must understand that my little
darling, Rose, so exquisitely pretty, so witty,
so charming, and so good <i>au fond</i>, was by no
means faultless.  She had her whims and
caprices, her faults and her follies, just as if
she were an ordinary woman, and not the
heroine of a three volume novel.  If I were
painting women as they <i>should be</i>, of course
no speck or flaw would I permit upon the
radiant loveliness of my picture; but women
as they <i>are</i>&mdash;the darlings!&mdash;admit of no such
flattery.
</p>

<p>
Rose reasoned thus:&mdash;He must know I love
him; or, if he is so blind as not to have seen
it, he ought at least to have persevered.  Who
ever heard of a man giving up a woman in
that cool way, because she did not throw herself
into his arms, the first moment it pleased
him to declare himself?  He can't be really
in love.  He is <i>rationally</i> attached to me; and
reason tells him to&mdash;go to Italy!  Does he
expect I am to follow him? does he expect I
am to write to him? does he expect I am to
be penitent?  He is greatly mistaken!  I will
forget him: I will!
</p>

<p>
But she could not.  She was angry with
him; but his image was constantly before her.
A spirit naturally high, and fostered into a
sort of pugnacity by the experience of her
school life, Rose was at all times too apt to
rebel against the least opposition, and never
learnt to brook what could be construed into
an insult.  Julius's conduct seemed to her an
insult.  Either it was dictated by a coolness
not akin to genuine love, or it was dictated by
a desire to make her repent her refusal.  She
adopted both suggestions alternately, and
both she construed into an offence.  Her
pride was roused, and the struggle between
pride and love had thrown her into that
"slight fever" of which she spoke to Blanche.
</p>

<p>
She went into society with the determination
of forgetting Julius, and of finding some one
to replace him in her heart&mdash;but found no one.
</p>

<p>
Violet began to suffer the depressing
forebodings of jealousy.  She loved Marmaduke,
and confessed it to herself.  His attentions
to Mrs. Vyner at first irritated her, because
she thought them hypocritical, knowing his
opinion of that false woman; and she could
not brook the idea of his stooping to conciliate
one he despised, although he did so merely to
gain a frequent admission to the house.  But
after a little while she fancied there was more
in his attentions, and that they had another
aim.
</p>

<p>
This idea was slow in gaining ground, but
it gained it steadily.  Unwilling as she must
have been to believe it, both on account of
Mrs. Vyner being married, and also on
account of Marmaduke's very expressive
attentions to herself, nevertheless there was no
withstanding the horrible suggestions of
appearances; and combat them as she might,
they gained ground in her mind.  Now rising
into something like a certainty, now driven
back again by some word, look, or act which
spoke too plainly of his love for her; but
advancing and receding, and advancing and
receding again, like the alternating progress
of a tide flowing in, this horrible idea gained
upon her.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke's conduct was indeed calculated
to foster that suspicion.  He was placed in a
strange position.  Violet he loved, ardently
loved; but his impetuous nature somewhat
curbed itself before her equally haughty, and
still more powerful mind.  Violet had the
superiority of moral elevation, and moral
firmness.  Marmaduke, though firm and dauntless,
was more volatile; his organization, was of that
nervous and impressionable order, which,
although capable of carrying him with indomitable
firmness through anything he willed, was
nevertheless more easily swayed by the caprice
and passion of the moment, than the more
self-sustained calm strength of Violet.  He
instinctively stood in a sort of awe of her.  He
bowed down to her superior nature, which he
admired and worshipped; but he did not feel
so much her slave as Mary Hardcastle had
made him feel hers.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps this difference arose from the
changes which had taken place in his own
nature, since the time when Mary Hardcastle
had called him hers.  I know not.  Certain it
is that the tiny sylph-like Mary exercised an
almost absolute power over him; while the
imperial Violet cowed, but did not master
him.  Above all, he was repelled by Violet's
coldness.  If in the country she had sometimes
damped his ardour by her haughty reserve,
she had, since their arrival in town, scarcely
ever unbended, for she was hurt at his
attentions to Mrs. Vyner.
</p>

<p>
From time to time he fancied he discerned
in her manner a secret passion for him, and
then his devotion to her was such as to irritate
Mrs. Vyner with tormenting suspicions.  But
these were only passing moods; Violet soon
relapsed into her old manner, and the baffled
indignant Marmaduke turned impatiently
again to Mrs. Vyner.
</p>

<p>
As love seemed denied him, at least he
would secure his revenge.  To secure that,
required immense thought and ingenuity.  He
bestowed upon it the patience and finesse of a
savage.  It was a drama which called forth all
his faculties, and which, as it might deepen
into tragedy at any moment, kept him in a
state of intense excitement, and greatly
confused his moral perceptions.
</p>

<p>
The last sentence is one upon which I would
lay great stress, because it enables me to
explain Marmaduke's actions, which, however
inexcusable, are not to be judged as if they
were the results of calm deliberation.  Passion
blinded him, as it blinds all men; confused his
judgment while sharpening his instincts; and
altogether distorted his sense of moral rectitude.
</p>

<p>
Nor is this all: the excitement not only
confused his moral sense, but also, by a
physiological law, the subtle power of sympathy,
changed what was originally a pretence into a
reality.  The love we begin by feigning, we
end by feeling; at least so far as the mere
sensuousness of the feeling goes.  Excitement
at all times has a singular power of awakening
into life the germs of vague desires.  It
intensifies a thought into a desire, a desire into
a passion.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke began by feigning a return of
his former love for Mrs. Meredith Vyner.
Her artful doubts increased his desire to
convince her.  His increased eagerness gave
greater sharpness, and distinctness to that
desire.  Carried away by his own acting, he
began at last to feel some of the passion of his
part.  Memory recalled the charms he once
adored; and Mrs. Vyner was there in all the
fascination of her strange beauty, to make his
pulses vibrate as of old.  The spell of those
tiger eyes; the perfume of that golden hair;
the witchery of that fantastic manner, began
to move the voluptuousness within him, as
before.  And the very restraints imposed upon
him no less by her position, than by her adroit
avoidance of him, irritated him the more.
She would not permit him to breathe a word
of his passion.  She would not suffer him to
take her hand; to his ardour she opposed her
affectation of moral scruples, and what "was
due to her husband!"  She kept him at a
distance, without forbidding him the house.
</p>

<p>
The result was, that Desire intensified the
passion of Revenge.  He not only burned to
conquer, in order that he might gratify the
dark passion which was rankling in his heart,
as it only rankles in those "children of the
sun," but also because the woman he hated
fascinated him.
</p>

<p>
This fascination will be incomprehensible to
those whose colder temperaments, or more
limited experience, have not brought home to
them the fact that we may at once despise and
admire; that we may have indeed, a positive
contempt for a person in whose presence we
are as if under a spell.
</p>

<p>
The secret is, that esteem and respect are
founded upon moral sympathies and judgments;
but the charm of beauty and manner
appeals to the more sensuous and emotional
parts of our nature, and these, while the charm
continues, triumph.
</p>

<p>
Thus Marmaduke, when alone, despised
Mrs. Meredith Vyner, as one who knew her;
but in her presence he was often strangely
fascinated.  Did he then cease to love Violet?
Not he.  His heart never wavered; never for
an instant did she step from off the pedestal
on which his love had placed her.  True that,
owing to the wide signification in which the
word Love is used, he may have been said at
times to love Mrs. Vyner, because he certainly
often felt for her that desire which is all some
men know of love.  But, call it by what name
you please, it had no affinity to the love he felt
for Violet.
</p>

<p>
And Mrs. Vyner?  She was proud, excessively
proud, of her triumph.  She watched
Violet's dawning jealousy, and deepening sadness,
with a quiet savageness, horrible to think
of; and she noted the increasing entanglement
of Marmaduke in her net, with the pride of a
coquette regaining her prey, and triumphing
over a handsomer younger woman.
</p>

<p>
She never for an instant doubted Marmaduke's
sincerity; and although his attentions
to Violet sometimes irritated her, she deceived
herself by supposing that he only paid them
to excite her jealousy.
</p>

<p>
I have observed a paradoxical fact in human
nature, which I here record, without professing
to explain it; and it is this&mdash;hypocrites are
easily duped by the hypocrisy of another, and
liars are always credulous.  La Rochefoucauld
has also noticed that "quelque défiance que
nous ayons de la sincérité de ceux qui nous
parlent, nous croyons toujours qu'ils nous
disent plus vrai qu'aux autres."  I suppose it
is in both cases our confidence in our own
sagacity which misleads us; but there is the
fact, let moralists make what they can of it.
</p>

<p>
Well, this fact explains to us why that
consummate actress, Mrs. Meredith Vyner, was
completely duped by the acting of Marmaduke,
the truth of whose passion she never
thought of doubting.  And what was said
before respecting the effect of acting upon the
mind, and its changing pretence into reality,
must also be applied to her: with all the
greater force arising from her mind not being
in any way disposed against him, as his mind
was against her.  If he, who hated her, was
insensibly led to feel something of the passion
which he feigned, how much more likely
would she be to admit the same influence, her
mind being free from all dislike?
</p>

<p>
She began to love him, but it was in her
way: with the head not the heart, with her
senses not her soul!

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
DOUBTS CHANGED INTO CERTAINTIES.
</h3>

<p>
Violet's fears were soon to be confirmed.
</p>

<p>
The reader may remember a certain Mrs. Henley,
mentioned in our prologue as the
friend who consented to favour the meetings
of Marmaduke and Mary, and whose kindness
Mary never, never could forget.  He will not
be surprised to hear that Mary Hardcastle, on
becoming Mrs. Meredith Vyner, considerately
cut her former friend; a proceeding which so
much astonished Mrs. Henley, that she
declared she had "always expected as much."
</p>

<p>
Now this Mrs. Henley was a sort of distant
cousin of the anecdotical Mrs. Merryweather,
who boarded at the Tring establishment.
Mrs. Henley calling one day upon her cousin, was
shown into that gloomy reception-room the
reader knows, and there, amongst other
subjects of gossip, the fellow-boarders of
Mrs. Merryweather were biographically and
critically touched upon by that lively lady.  When
she came to Blanche, and mentioned her being
the daughter of no less a person than Meredith
Vyner, Esq., Mrs. Henley interrupted her to
give a detailed character of Mrs. Vyner, with
an eloquent account of her base ingratitude,
and of the shameful way in which she had
treated poor Mr. Ashley.
</p>

<p>
This information Mrs. Merryweather, of
course, imparted to Blanche, with more
circumlocutions and interspersed anecdotes than
the reader would like to have set down here.
Blanche, aware of the state of her sister's
affections, felt somewhat uneasy on learning
Marmaduke's previous attachment; and although
she did not guess how matters stood,
yet the idea of his having so far forgotten his
former love, as to pay court to a step-daughter
greatly puzzled her.
</p>

<p>
The next time Violet and Rose called upon
her, she communicated to them the information
she had received.  Rose was greatly scandalized,
Violet deeply moved.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens!" exclaimed Rose, "to
think of mama having behaved so!  But can
it be true?  Yes; the information is too
precise.  Yet Marmaduke has forgiven...."
</p>

<p>
"But not <i>forgotten</i> her!" said Violet, in a
calm, stern voice.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"He loves her still."
</p>

<p>
"Violet!"
</p>

<p>
"I am very serious."
</p>

<p>
"And his attentions to you...?"
</p>

<p>
"Hypocrisy!"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!  Violet, how can you think
so ill of people?"
</p>

<p>
"You often ask me, Rose, how I can think
so ill of mama.  Yet you have to-day heard
that which will partly justify me.  You believe
that mama assists dear Blanche, by money
saved from her own allowance.  I know that it
is papa who sends the money.  I tell you she
is made up of falsehood."
</p>

<p>
"But Marmaduke?"
</p>

<p>
"Of him I thought better&mdash;yet you see?"
</p>

<p>
"I see nothing.  He loves you&mdash;has forgiven
mama, and is attentive to her merely to
gain opportunities of seeing you."
</p>

<p>
Violet shook her head mournfully.
</p>

<p>
"Do not condemn him unheard, Violet.
Watch him closely, then question him.  You
know not what explanation he may have.  Oh! do
not let there be more misunderstanding in
our family."
</p>

<p>
Violet had turned away her head to conceal
her tears, but the effort was in vain; her
uncontrollable grief burst forth more violently
from having been a while restrained.
</p>

<p>
She resolved to bring Marmaduke to an
explanation that very evening, and the resolution
calmed her.
</p>

<p>
It so happened that during the day
Marmaduke had been more than usually irritated
by Mrs. Vyner's manners.  He had spoken to
her eloquent words of love, and demanded
a return; the more impassioned he became,
the more she drew back behind her position as
a married woman.
</p>

<p>
"You love me," he exclaimed, "I know you
love me.  You cannot deny it."
</p>

<p>
"Marmaduke, I have already told you this
is language I must not, will not listen to."
</p>

<p>
"Answer me: can you deny it?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall answer nothing of the kind."
</p>

<p>
"But I insist."
</p>

<p>
"If I must leave the room," she said, "if you
force me to leave it,&mdash;and unless you change
the subject, I shall certainly do so,&mdash;this will
be the last time I shall ever trust myself in
your presence."
</p>

<p>
He rose, and took up his hat as if to depart.
</p>

<p>
"Mary, you will repent this."
</p>

<p>
She only shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
He moved towards the door.
</p>

<p>
"Do you dine here to-day?" she said, with
an affectation of carelessness, through which
pierced an entreaty.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
He left her in anger.  He did not dine
there that day, but he came in during the
evening.  Rose and Violet, watching his manner
very closely, could see nothing in it but
polished courtesy, mixed with some slight
indications of dislike towards Mrs. Vyner,
unmixed courtesy towards Meredith Vyner, and
unmistakeable affection for Violet.
</p>

<p>
In truth he was more attentive to Violet that
evening, owing to the scene just recorded; and
when Mrs. Vyner proposed a game at chess
he declined it, on the ground that he should
not be able to stay long enough that evening;
he was engaged to two parties.  Yet he never
moved from Violet's side until past eleven!
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Rose, as she went into Violet's
room that night, "what do you say now?"
</p>

<p>
"I think you are right."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure of it."
</p>

<p>
"And yet, Rose&mdash;place yourself in my
position&mdash;is it not horrible to think of his having
once loved her?"
</p>

<p>
Rose felt that it was, but unwilling to say
so, merely remarked that he was then but a
boy, and boys must love somebody.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but <i>her</i>!  Any one rather than her!
Oh, Rose, I shall never be happy!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't say that.  He has clearly forgotten
all about it&mdash;treats it as a boyish flirtation.
His heart is undeniably yours&mdash;happy girl that
you are to be able to say so!  Would that I
could know Julius was mine on the same conditions!"
</p>

<p>
"Would you accept him?"
</p>

<p>
"Gladly."
</p>

<p>
"And the thought of her would not poison
your happiness?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
Violet sighed deeply, and was silent.  She
tried to persuade herself that she ought not
to be affected by the dark and bitter thoughts
arising from the discovery of her lover's prior
attachment; but instinctively she returned to
the subject, to dwell on it with morbid satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
She passed a wretched night.  Broken dreams
of Marmaduke at her mother's feet, suddenly
changing to dreams of her own marriage,
interrupted at the foot of the altar, made her
sleep restless.  Her waking thoughts were
scarcely less irritating.  Sometimes she would
try to believe that Mrs. Henley might have
been misinformed, sometimes that the
Mr. Ashley of whom she spoke might have been
another Mr. Ashley, and sometimes that it
was a mere flirtation which gossip had magnified,
into an engagement.  But these thoughts
were chased away by the recollection of
various looks interchanged with Marmaduke,
when her mother was mentioned, looks which
plainly told her that he had discovered the
falsehood which was under the little creature's
affected sensibility and goodness.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0503"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
DECLARATION.
</h3>

<p>
Marmaduke persevered for several days in
his system of polite indifference towards
Mrs. Meredith Vyner, while his attentions to Violet
became more and more explicit.  Her suspicions
were gradually giving way.
</p>

<p>
One evening they sat in the drawing-room
discussing <i>Norma</i>, which they had seen the
night before; and passing from the singers
to the story, Violet remarked what a grand
tragic idea it contained.
</p>

<p>
"Yet I scarcely think," said Mrs. Vyner,
"that the story is taken up at its best point.
Suppose the author had shown us the early
struggles of Norma&mdash;her passion gradually
consuming religious scruples&mdash;would not that
have been fine?  Then, again, after she loves
Pollio, her struggles to conceal from others
the crime she has been guilty of; surely
there is nothing more fearful than the
combat in a woman's breast, when she is hourly
striving first to resist a passion, and then to
conceal it because she knows its guilt!"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were bent upon Marmaduke as
she said this, and Violet noticed their strange
expression.
</p>

<p>
"You will accuse me of libelling your
sex," said he, laughing, "if I answer as I
think."
</p>

<p>
"Let us hear what ill you think of us,"
said Rose.  "Mr. Wincot will defend us, I
am sure; won't you?"
</p>

<p>
Tom Wincot, who was quietly winning
Vyner's money at écarté, answered, as he
marked the king,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You know, Miss Wose, knight-ewantwy
is a principle with me; without being
womantic I have an exaggewated wespect for the
sex, which makes me cwedulous of all their
virtues; so wely on me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I am not going to maintain my
opinion at the sword's point," said Marmaduke;
"but, nevertheless, since you wish to
hear it, this it is: women are such capital
actresses, that I fancy it would have given
Norma very little trouble either to feign or
conceal any feeling she pleased."
</p>

<p>
"Atwocious! ... (I pwopose&mdash;thwee, if
you please)."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ashley's opinion of the sex does not
say much for his acquaintance with it," said
Violet, with a slight touch of scorn in her
tone.
</p>

<p>
"It does not," he replied; "in fact, my
<i>early</i> impressions were not calculated to make
me gallant."
</p>

<p>
He looked at Mrs. Vyner as he spoke; she
kept her eyes fixed on her embroidery; but
Violet noticed her efforts to conceal agitation.
</p>

<p>
The entrance of Sir Chetsom Chetsom put
an end to the discussion.  The old beau was
more resplendent than ever; and the belief
that Hester loved him had really made him
look younger.  Conversation became frivolous
at once, except between Marmaduke and
Violet, who were earnestly talking together:
too earnestly for Mrs. Vyner's comfort, and,
accordingly, she from time to time addressed
a question to Marmaduke, in the hope of
bringing him into the general discourse; but
he contented himself with a simple reply,
and then resumed what he was saying to
Violet.
</p>

<p>
Jealousy was tormenting Mrs. Vyner, and
Marmaduke knew it.  He had so studied
every look and movement of her, that, actress
as she was, she could not easily deceive him;
and he felt a strange delight in thus
penetrating beneath her mask, and there
contemplating the agitated features.
</p>

<p>
To understand his persistance in the perilous
game he was playing, you must endeavour to
appreciate the strange, intense, never-ceasing
excitement which every scene of the drama
afforded him; you must remember that almost
every phrase had its interpretation, every
trivial act revealed some motive, every look
was carefully noted.  Of her consummate
hypocrisy he was fully aware; but he was
also aware that she loved him.  How much
was love, and how much pretence, he could
not tell, and he was always on the alert to
discover it; meanwhile, the very doubt was
an extra stimulus.  Those who, no matter for
what purpose, have ever been obliged thus to
watch the acts, words, and looks of one whose
real motives and feelings it is important they
should detect, will be able to understand the
excitement of this situation.  Marmaduke the
more readily indulged in it owing to his
peculiar organization, which made excitement a
sort of necessary stimulus to him.
</p>

<p>
That very evening he saw her turning over
the leaves of a book, occasionally casting an
anxious glance at the contents, which made
him aware that she was seeking for some
particular passage.  At last she seemed to find
it.  The silk ribbon, which served to mark the
place, she moved from where it was before,
and with a careless and apparently unintentional
action, let it fall at that part of the
volume which she then held open.  Turning over
a few more leaves, she then closed the book,
and leaned her arm upon it.
</p>

<p>
Violet had also noticed this, but in that
casual way in which we notice things which
have no significance for us at the time, though
afterwards, when some light is thrown upon
them, the memory repeats every detail.  This
she had <i>seen</i> without <i>observing</i>.  In about ten
minutes afterwards Mrs. Vyner said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"By-the-bye, Mr. Ashley, were not you to
borrow my Petrarch?  Here it is for you.
Be careful of it, for it is one of my favourite
books."
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke at once guessed there was
something in this offer, which did not appear
on the face of it; and then recollecting her
search for a passage, and the removal of the
book-marker, concluded that the passage was
meant for him to read.
</p>

<p>
Violet recollected it also, and rightly guessed
the meaning.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke took the volume, and placed
it on a side table, and then resumed his
conversation with Violet.
</p>

<p>
Her anxiety to get hold of the volume, and
read the pages where the book-marker was
placed, became so great that she soon ceased to
pay any attention to what he said.  By way of
diverting him from the present position, she
proposed that they should sing a duet.  He
readily accepted, and Rossini's <i>M'abbraccia
Argirio</i> was at once commenced.
</p>

<p>
When that was finished, Violet asked him
to sing <i>Io son ricco e tu sei bella</i> from L'Elisire
d'Amore, with Rose, and while they were
singing it, she returned to her former place.
Then, as if casually, but with an agitated
heart, she took up the Petrarch.  It opened
at the Trionfo della Morte, at that passage
where Laura makes the exquisite avowal of
her love veiled by reserve; as Violet read
these words,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">

  Da te non fu'l mio cor, nè giammai fia;<br>

  Era alla nostra giovinetta fama;*<br>
</p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Never was my heart separated from thee, never will it
be; but I tempered the ardour of thy passion with the austerity
of my look, since there was no other way to save us both."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Her breath was suspended, and with a feeling
of sick anxiety, she continued to read,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Quante volte diss' io: questi non ama<br>
  Anzi arde, onde convien ch' a ciò proveggia.<br>
  E mal può proveder chi teme o brama.<br>
  <i>Quel di fuor miri, e quel dentro non veggia</i>.*<br>
</p>

<p class="footnote">
* "How often have I said to myself, he loves me, nay, he
burns for me, and I must avert the danger: let him see my
face, but not what passes in my heart!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Her head began to swim; there was no
mistaking the significance of the avowal.  With
an effort she continued&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Più di mille fiate ira dipinse<br>
  Il volto mio, ch' amor ardeva il core,<br>
  Ma voglia in me ragion giammai non vinse.<br>
  Poi se vinto ti vidi dal dolore<br>
  Drizzai'n te gli occhi allor soavemente<br>
  Salvando la tua vita e'l nostro onore.*<br>
</p>

<p class="footnote">
* "A thousand times and more, anger was painted on my
brow, while love flamed in my heart; but never did desire
vanquish reason in me.  Then, when I saw thee subdued by
grief, I softly raised my eyes to thine, thus saving thy life and
our honour."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
The lights danced before her eyes, her head
was dizzy, and had she been alone she must
have fainted; but the strong necessity for
self-mastery gave her strength.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke's clear voice was at that moment
giving mock tenderness to the words&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Idol mio non più rigor,<br>
  Fa felice un senator.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Tom Wincot was leisurely dealing.
</p>

<p>
Violet was horribly conscious of her position,
and gaining, in that consciousness, energy
enough to subdue her emotion, with a trembling
hand she replaced the book.  As she did
so, her eye encountered, for an instant, the
piercing gaze of Mrs. Vyner.  It was but
a look, it lasted but an instant, but in that
look what meaning was concentrated!
</p>

<p>
The duet was finished, and Mrs. Vyner
was by Marmaduke's side, complimenting
him on his singing, before Violet had
recovered from the shock which that look had
given her.
</p>

<p>
What a situation!  Not only had she
intercepted Mrs. Vyner's unmistakeable avowal,
but she had been detected by her in the
very act.  The secret was not only discovered,
but it was known to be discovered.
</p>

<p>
Violet, unable longer to remain in the room,
retired quietly to indulge in her intense sorrow
by herself.
</p>

<p>
With a sense of utter desolation she threw
herself on a chair, her eyes fixed vacantly on
the ground, her hurrying thoughts whirling
round one object, restless, agitating, and
feverish.  She did not cry at first: it was more like
stupor than grief; but as her ideas became
clearer, they awakened her to anguish, and
she wept.
</p>

<p>
She wept over the hopelessness of her love;
she wept over the degradation of her lover.
Low sobs burst from her, and the tears
which rolled down her cheeks were unchecked.
</p>

<p>
A touch upon her hand startled her: it was
the rough paw of her affectionate Shot, who
had been seated by her side, looking
sorrowfully in her face, sympathizing with her
sorrow; finding himself unheeded, he had
lifted his paw, and rested it upon her hand.
She smiled mournfully upon him through her
tears; he answered her with a plaintive whine,
and rising upon his hind legs, thrust his shaggy
head caressingly into her hand.
</p>

<p>
"My poor Shot!" she said, "<i>you</i> love me&mdash;you
are not false!"
</p>

<p>
He whined again, and thrust his nose into
her hand.
</p>

<p>
But his demonstrations of affection only
made her grief the greater, his caressing
whining sympathy only made her more painfully
aware of her need for sympathy, and she sank
back in a paroxysm of tears which lasted some
time.  Then rising, she dried her eyes, gulped
down her sighs with a strong effort, and said,&mdash;"I
will endure!"
</p>

<p>
The passion of her grief had passed, and she
was calm.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0504"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
THE TEMPEST LOURS.
</h3>

<p>
Immediately on reaching home that night,
Marmaduke sat down to read the pages of
Petrarch, which had been so significantly
marked for him.  As he found the passages
before quoted, his attention became excessively
eager; and having read them with curious
emotion, he re-read them with intense care,
weighing every line, and interpreting them to
the fullest extent.
</p>

<p>
He let the book fall upon the table, and
throwing himself back in his arm chair, allowed
the current of his thoughts to take their
flattering course.
</p>

<p>
No man can receive, unmoved, the avowal
of a woman's love; and when that avowal
breaks through all prudence, and disdains all
ties, the flattery is irresistible.  To
Marmaduke, it had an additional charm: it was the
capitulation of an enemy he had almost
despaired of conquering.  His revenge was at
hand!
</p>

<p>
But now the crisis was so near, his
perplexity became tenfold.  Now Mrs. Vyner
was won, he was condemned to adopt some
plan which would both secure his vengeance,
yet not lose Violet.
</p>

<p>
Violet had not been so cold of late.  His
ideas also became clearer.  The agitation of
doubt once passed&mdash;Mrs. Vyner's declaration
having stilled his impatience&mdash;his love for
Violet resumed its empire.  He saw that his
vengeance was impossible, if he still thought of
her; yet he could not renounce his vengeance.
How to attain both objects?  He would invent
some plan.
</p>

<p>
He was in anxious doubt.  The invention
on which he had relied to extricate him when
the crisis came was now powerless.  He could
think of nothing feasible.
</p>

<p>
Men who scheme are too apt to be caught
in their own nets, from this reckless confidence
in their resources.  They foresee the danger
but shut their eyes to it.  They propose to
avoid it by "some plan."  But the vagueness
of "some" plan, has to be changed into the
precision of one decided plan, when the time
for action arrives; and this must be one
adequate to the occasion.
</p>

<p>
The next day Violet accompanied Rose on a
visit to Fanny Worsley, who was about to be
married.  The invitation was eagerly accepted
by Violet, for home had become hideous since
the fatal discovery of Mrs. Vyner's guilty
passion.  The agonizing struggles she had
gone through on becoming fully aware of her
own hopeless love, had sorely tried the strength
of her soul; for although she could not doubt
that Marmaduke loved her, however inexplicable
his relations to Mrs. Vyner, yet she at once
saw that these must utterly destroy all hope of
ever being united to him, even could she so far
overcome her own scruples as to accept him.
But the masculine strength of mind with which
she was endowed, saved her from being entirely
prostrated by the blow.  She rose up against
misfortune, looked it fixedly, though mournfully,
in the face, saw its extent, and resigned
herself with stoic courage.  Suffer she did, and
deeply; but she bore it as an irremediable
affliction, and thus, by shutting herself from
the wearying agitations of fallacious hopes,
saved herself from a great source of pain.
</p>

<p>
Rose had marked the sudden change in her
demeanour, and the traces of violent grief in
her face; but all her affectionate questions had
been so evidently painful, that she ceased to
ask them.  The impatience Violet exhibited to
be gone, the anxiety to leave home, more and
more excited her curiosity, and as the carriage
rolled away from the door, and Violet fervently
exclaimed "thank God!" Rose twined an arm
round her waist, and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dearest Violet, tell me what has
happened.  Something I know has.  Your
wretchedness is too visible.  Do tell me."
</p>

<p>
Violet burst into tears, and throwing her
arms round her sister's neck, kept her tightly
embraced for some minutes, sobbing fearfully,
and kissing her, but making no effort to
speak.
</p>

<p>
"Talk of it, do dear," said Rose, sobbing
with her; "it will comfort you."
</p>

<p>
Violet only pressed her closer.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me what it is.  Perhaps I shall be able
to explain it."
</p>

<p>
Violet sobbed, and shook her head in
despair.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, dear, Violet!  Don't give way so.
Tell me what it is.  It may be only some
misunderstanding.  It may be cleared up by a
word."
</p>

<p>
Not a word escaped from the wretched girl.
Rose wiped away her sister's fast falling tears,
and then wiped her own eyes, and kissed and
entreated, but no answer could she get, beyond
a sob, a moan, or a violent pressure of the
hand.
</p>

<p>
In this way they rode on for some miles.
</p>

<p>
Exhausted with weeping, Violet closed her
eyes, and dozed awhile upon her sister's
shoulder.  When she awoke she was calm
again.  A deep, unutterable sadness, sharpened
her pallid features; and, in a low voice,
she said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dear Rose, let me beg of you to ask me
no questions respecting my grief: it is
irreparable, and it cannot be mentioned.  I shall
have strength to bear it, at least I hope so&mdash;but
not strength to talk of it.  Leave me to my
own reflections and to time.  Let them know
at Fanny's that I have been ill, and am not yet
recovered; but give no hint of any cause for
sorrow."

CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
VACILLATION.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
<i>Lady Plyant</i>.  O consider it, what you would have to answer
for, if you should provoke me to frailty.  Alas! humanity is
feeble, and unable to support itself.
</p>

<p class="intro">
WYCHERLEY.&mdash;<i>The Double Dealer.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Marmaduke called, he found Mrs. Vyner
as polite and as distant as before, with
something in her manner which looked like
timidity.  He had anticipated a very different
reception.  After the implicit avowal, contained
in the passage of Petrarch, he anticipated that
all coquetry, all reserve, would be cast aside,
and that she would throw herself into his
arms.  How little he understood her!
</p>

<p>
Irritated by this resumption of her former
manner, he at last said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mary, I am not to be trifled with any
longer.  Tell me once for all,&mdash;Did you give
me that book on Monday evening to make a
fool of me; or did you give it that I might
understand you?"
</p>

<p>
She was knitting a purse, and continued her
work without making the slightest observation.
</p>

<p>
"Mary, take care! take care!  I am violent&mdash;do
not rouse me.  I must decide to-day
whether I am to be your's or <i>another's</i>."
</p>

<p>
She trembled slightly as he said this, and
raised her eyes to his.
</p>

<p>
"You have played with my affection too
long already.  To-day must end it.  Mary, do
you love me?"
</p>

<p>
She kept her eyes fixed upon his, and
smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I will take no equivocal answer," he said,
rising, and approaching her; "if it is to end,
it had better end at once."
</p>

<p>
She shook back her golden tresses, and
motioning him to be seated, with a most
significant smile, said,&mdash;"Marmaduke, you need
not go."
</p>

<p>
He sat upon the ground at her feet, and
looking up into her face, whispered,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My own Mary!"
</p>

<p>
She drooped over him, so as to cover his
head with her luxuriant hair, and kissed him
on the brow.
</p>

<p>
His heart swelled with triumph, and his
senses were violently agitated.
</p>

<p>
She also triumphed, as she gazed upon the
fierce, impetuous creature whom she had
subdued, and who now sat at her feet, his head
resting on her lap, passion darting from his
lustrous eyes, sitting there her slave and her
adorer.  A scornful remembrance of the
haughty Violet, over whom she now
triumphed, gave additional keenness to her
delight.
</p>

<p>
After allowing him to remain some minutes
in ecstatic contemplation, she bade him rise.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let me still sit here.  Here could I
spend my life.  Here, my own exquisite Mary,
at your feet&mdash;your strange eyes looking thus
into mine, and stirring the fibres of my heart
as no eyes ever stirred them."
</p>

<p>
"Dearest Marmaduke, remember our love
is sacred, but it must not make us forget prudence&mdash;
</p>

<p class="t3">
  Salvando la tua vita e'l nostro onore."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
This quotation from the passage in Petrarch
at once checked the current of Marmaduke's
feelings, and made him remember he had a
part to play.  It quelled the emotions of the
scene, and recalled to him that he was but an
actor.
</p>

<p>
He rose, and with well-feigned reluctance
entered into her plans for the preservation of
her honour and her virtue, without, at the
same time, affecting their love.  They were to
love Platonically; they were to imitate
Petrarch and Laura in the depth, constancy, and
purity of their affection.
</p>

<p>
"Now," thought he, "for my revenge."
</p>

<p>
How great his vexation when he found that
Violet had left home, and left it for some
weeks.  He had anticipated an immediate
triumph; he thought from vows of Platonic
and Petrarchian love to pass at once to his
declaration to Violet, so that his engagement
to her should come upon Mrs. Vyner like a
thunderclap.  But now he saw this delayed
for weeks; and to one of his impatient temper
this was a serious irritation.
</p>

<p>
The absence of Violet weakened his resolution.
He was too susceptible of Mrs. Vyner's
personal charms, and too fascinated by her
manner, to remain long in her society without
danger.  So long as Violet was present, her
magnificent beauty and strong character were
as spells upon him, which counteracted the
more sensual attractions of Mrs. Vyner, and
kept him to his meditated plans.  But Violet
absent, his senses and vanity were laid open
to the assaults of the adroit coquette.  He
became more and more in earnest.  His desire
for her possession daily encroached upon
his desire for vengeance; till at last he began
to think only of accomplishing the former.
</p>

<p>
The reader may condemn him: he will do
so; but he should remember that Marmaduke
was no paragon of virtue, who could resist the
temptations of his senses and his vanity.  He
belonged, indeed, to that race of human beings
on whom, however great the moral qualities,
yet, from their highly nervous organizations,
temptation comes with tenfold force to what
it does on colder-blooded mortals.  He had
fine qualities; but neither his education nor his
organization fitted him for a paragon.  He was,
indeed, a most imperfect hero: very erring,
very human.  And, bold and reckless as he
was, he pursued the suggestions of his erring
nature without regard to consequences: if
those suggestions were noble, they led him
to heroism; if base, they led him to crime.
I state the facts, "nothing extenuate, nor
set down aught in malice;" let those cast
the first stone at him, who feel they can do
so with a clear conscience.

CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
THE TRIAL.
</h3>

<p class="poem2">
  Sa pensée est un monde son cœur un abîme;<br>
  C'est ainsi qu'elle va, forte, de crime en crime<br>
  Bravant impunément et la peuple et la cour<br>
  Ne méritant que haine et n'inspirant qu'amour!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAD. EMILE GIRARDIN.&mdash;<i>Cléopatre</i>.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Poor Meredith Vyner was tormented with
jealousy.  He had blindly credited his wife,
when she told him that she sought to bring
about a match between Marmaduke and
Violet, and had rivalled her in his attentions
to the bold suitor, who was to wed this
imperious girl.  But from time to time he had
felt twinges of jealousy.  It seemed to him
that Marmaduke was a great deal too
attentive to his wife.  He dared not make any
remark; but he observed it with pain.  Now,
that Violet was away, and he saw Marmaduke
still more assiduous in his visits, saw him daily
in the house, and closeted with his wife for
hours together, his suspicions began to assume
a more galling fixity.
</p>

<p>
He could not deceive himself respecting the
dangerous attractions of his rival.  He could
not persuade himself that a man of his age
had any strong hold of a young woman's
affections.  Indeed, his wife had recently too
often reminded him of the difference of their
ages, and made him feel too grateful for the
slightest show of affection, for him to doubt
the precariousness of his tenure.  It was one
of the weapons she used against him; she
knew its value, and never allowed it to rust.
Although, therefore, he adored her, was proud
of her, was proud of even the slight degree
of love she pretended to feel for him, he began
to feel that the degree was but small; and this
was perhaps the principal cause of his
submissive spaniel-like adoration.  Poor human
nature!
</p>

<p>
If, however, the consciousness of the small
return which his affection met with, made that
affection greater, it also made his jealousy
more poignant, and more easily alarmed.  He
never saw any one pay her the slightest
attention without a qualm.  He was jealous of old
men, he was jealous of young men; he was
jealous of fools, he was jealous of wits; he was
even jealous of his daughters, because she
showed them so much tenderness!
</p>

<p>
Judge, then, what he must have felt when he
began to see clearly into the nature of
Marmaduke's attention!  The poor old pedant used
to pace up and down his study, sometimes up
and down the corridor, while Marmaduke was
sitting alone with her in the drawing-room, or
in her boudoir; never venturing to enter,
lest his anxiety should be legible on his
countenance, and counting the minutes till the
tête-à-tête broke up.
</p>

<p>
Several times, while she was out in the
carriage, did he open her escritoire, of which he
had a duplicate key, and hurriedly read all the
letters there locked up.  But he found nothing
that he could construe into an appearance
of criminality.  The notes from Marmaduke
were friendly answers to invitations, for the
most part, or trifling communications, in which
no word of tenderness, no allusion to secrets,
could give him the slightest uneasiness.
Marmaduke had been too guarded ever to allow
himself a suspicious phrase.  Not that he
feared Vyner, but because he knew the danger
of letters.
</p>

<p>
These fruitless searches only threw the
jealous husband into fresh perplexities, and
made him doubt the justice of the suspicions
which Marmaduke's manner invariably revived.
</p>

<p>
Nor was it Marmaduke's attentions which
alone alarmed him.  His wife's manner was
greatly changed.  She no longer came into
his study that he might read aloud to her for
an hour or two in the morning.  She no longer
interested herself in his Horatian labours.  She
no longer cajoled him, no longer petted him.
She was fretful, capricious, abstracted.  She
threw his old age more frequently in his face.
She began to talk sentimentally about
"incompatibilities;" and to declaim about the
necessity for "passion."  The gay, little, sarcastic,
worldly-wise woman changed into a fervent
admirer of Petrarch, Byron, and Rousseau.
</p>

<p>
Symptoms not to be mistaken!
</p>

<p>
The truth is, Mrs. Vyner, always more in
earnest than Marmaduke, had now so completely
caught the feeling of the part she had
assumed, that from feigning, it had passed into
reality.  She loved him.  She even sighed
over her lot in being wedded to another, and
reproached herself for having been false to
her first love.
</p>

<p>
What had she gained by her falsehood?
Station and wealth; but with it a false and
difficult position as stepmother to three girls;
and an old, foolish, pedantic husband whom
she mastered, but could not love.  And what
are wealth and station in comparison with
affection?
</p>

<p>
The amount of the change which had taken
place may be estimated by that one question.
</p>

<p>
Such being the disposition of the parties, it
may seem strange that matters did not speedily
come to a crisis.  But neither the passion of
these guilty lovers, nor the jealousy of the
husband forced a crisis; and for this reason:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke had early committed a capital
mistake; a mistake, I mean, in gallantry.  Urged
by the impetuosity of his nature, he had endeavoured
to overcome her resistance by persuading
her to be his.  Now, a woman yields from excitement,
not from persuasion: passion, not argument,
is the instrument of her fall.  In
endeavouring to argue the point with her, he was
always at a disadvantage, because his cause
was so bad, and he forced her to bring forward
good reasons for refusal.  Having uttered these
reasons she was forced to abide by them, not
because they were right, but because she could
not so glaringly contradict them by her acts.
</p>

<p>
To put the case to the reader's experience
I would say, that many a time has he, the
reader, been refused a kiss he was fool enough
to ask for, which he might have had for the
taking!
</p>

<p>
The consequence was, that Mrs. Vyner kept
within the programme of Platonic love; and
this she managed without exasperating
Marmaduke beyond endurance.  An adroit woman
has a thousand ways of preserving herself, and
Mrs. Vyner was exceedingly adroit.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, she indulged in her passion
without troubling herself much about
consequences.  She was content with keeping
Marmaduke her slave.  The delight that gave
her is indescribable.  She was always inventing
some new plan to assure herself of it.
</p>

<p>
One day he was seated with her in the
boudoir, which I have not yet described, but
which, as the temple where she received her
devotees, merits a few words.  It was
exquisitely fitted up.  To throw the proper light
upon her blonde beauty, the furniture was of
a pale blue; and the curtains which, in lieu
of a door, separated the boudoir from the
bed-room, were of blue velvet.  The walls were
painted: a light, elegant border of arabesque,
and a centre piece of flowers on a light blue
ground.  A few statuettes, and some recherché
knicknacks, were distributed with art
about the room.
</p>

<p>
Dressed in a light peignoir, the deep rich
lace trimmings of which only half concealed
her dazzling bosom, she looked a most seductive
syren in this retreat, and it is no wonder
that Marmaduke's senses were captivated.
</p>

<p>
On that day, she was fretful.  Never had
he known her so exasperated against her
husband, and against the wretched bondage in
which she was held as wife to a man she
could not love.  To hear her talking about
"incompatibilities," and the "degradation"
of being linked to one man, while her heart
was another's, you would have supposed she
had been forced into the match, had been sold
by some mercenary parent.  From time to
time, she would throw up her eyes and sighing
exclaim,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No escape! to think there is no escape!"
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke could not comprehend this.
He understood clearly enough that she never
had loved Vyner; but why these bitter
complaints at this moment?
</p>

<p>
The truth is, she was about to make a great,
a wanton experiment of her power over him;
she wished to see how far his passion had
made him her blind and willing instrument;
and she suddenly interrupted an eloquent
speech of his by,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Of what use is protestation?  You say you
love me.  You say that you would move
heaven and earth to gain me; yet you do
nothing: it is all talk."
</p>

<p>
"Do!  What can I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Is it for me to tell you?" she said scornfully.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her wonderingly; but she
had resumed her work and was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Abuse me for my stupidity," he said;
"for upon my word, I do not understand you."
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"Will you not tell me?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
She took a skein of silk and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hold this, while I wind it."
</p>

<p>
She fixed the skein on his hands, and
began calmly winding, as if nothing whatever
had been said.  He waited a few moments
expecting her to speak, but she gave no signs
of intending to pursue the subject.
</p>

<p>
"Why will you not tell me what is in your
thoughts at this moment?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Contempt."
</p>

<p>
"For what?"
</p>

<p>
"For mere talkers."
</p>

<p>
"If you mean me, the contempt is undeserved.
Tell me what it is that can be done,
and it shall be done."
</p>

<p>
She continued to wind the silk, but refused
to answer.
</p>

<p>
"Mary, dear Mary, tell me what you mean."
</p>

<p>
She kept her eyes bent down and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Can you not guess?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot."
</p>

<p>
She was again silent.  The silk was all
wound.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?  For God's sake, speak!"
</p>

<p>
"There is an obstacle to our happiness&mdash;is
there not?"
</p>

<p>
"There is."
</p>

<p>
"And but one?"
</p>

<p>
"But one."
</p>

<p>
She raised her head a little, so as to look
him full in the face, and then closing her eyes,
in the way peculiar to her, suddenly flashed
them upon him.  In that instant he divined
the diabolical thought which was in her mind,
but which she did not dare to utter; he felt a
sickening disgust steal over him, as this idea
rushed hideously into his soul.
</p>

<p>
There was a breathless pause.  He mastered
his emotion as well as he could, and
determined to have no possible uncertainty on
the subject, but to make her avow it in all its
explicitness.  Collecting himself, therefore, he
whispered,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>That obstacle must be removed!</i>"
</p>

<p>
A strange expression stole over her eyes, as
she heard this, and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Have you the courage?"
</p>

<p>
He could scarcely falter out,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I have!"
</p>

<p>
Her point was gained.  She no more meant
her horrible suggestion to be realized, than he
meant to realize it.  They were both trying
each other.  She, to see the extent of her
power; he, to ascertain the truth of his suspicions.
</p>

<p>
Imagining her power great enough to lead
him into any crime, she burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
"And do you mean to say you thought me
serious, Marmaduke?"
</p>

<p>
"I did."
</p>

<p>
"Then what a villain you must be!"
</p>

<p>
"I am only your slave."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head at him, and said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Slaves should not listen to such thoughts.
If I thought you were serious, I should loathe you."
</p>

<p>
"And I should loathe myself," he said, coldly.
</p>

<p>
It so happened that both believed the other
guilty of the serious intention, and attributed
the disavowal to fear of having been understood.
Marmaduke had noticed the affected
tone of her laughter; it was affected, but not
from the cause he imagined: it arose from a
sense of uneasiness at having pushed the
experiment too far, and from a dread of his
really believing her to be serious.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, she noticed the faltering
hesitation and coldness of his tone, which she
interpreted into the uneasiness of guilt, but
which really arose from the intense loathing he
felt for her.  It only seemed a confirmation of
her power.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could ever have persuaded Marmaduke
that Mrs. Vyner was innocent of the
thoughts he attributed to her; and his loathing
was so great, that it not only completely crushed
the sort of love he had felt for her, but revived
his desire for vengeance, which he thought could
not be made terrible enough to fitly punish
such a wretch.
</p>

<p>
He dissembled his disgust, and only more
urgently pleaded her to elope with him.  At
the conclusion of one of his speeches to that
effect, he noticed that she seemed not to attend
to him, but to be eagerly listening.  Presently
she put her finger upon her lips by way of
caution, and then, in a voice she strove to make
calm and distinct, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Marmaduke, I do not doubt your love, but
I must not, will not listen to it.  I am married.
I never can forget that; do not you!  If a
sisterly regard will suffice you, that will I give;
but you must here engage to think of me as a
brother, and, above all, never again to let me
hear from your lips the language I have heard
to-day.  Will you promise me?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded significantly to him to reply in
the affirmative, and he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Will you, then, give me no hope?"
</p>

<p>
"None.  You have heard my conditions.
Do you accept them?"
</p>

<p>
"If I must."
</p>

<p>
"You must."
</p>

<p>
"Then I do."
</p>

<p>
"That's right.  Now go home."
</p>

<p>
She put her finger again upon her lips, and
motioned him to listen.
</p>

<p>
The gentle creak of retiring footsteps stealing
away was then distinctly heard.  As they
ceased, she said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"That was my husband.  He has overheard
us.  But fortunately he heard nothing which I
cannot explain.  Leave him to me."
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke went home in a state of fever,
torn by the most vehement emotions, and
seeing all darkly before him.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
FATHER AND CHILD.
</h3>

<p>
Meredith Vyner stole back to his study,
after having overheard a portion of the
foregoing scene, like one who has just received a
sentence of death.  He loved his wife with the
unreasoning idolatry of one who has centred
all his affections on a single object.  His
children had been gradually estranged from
him, his wife had taken their place in his
heart, and now she was listening to the vows
of another!
</p>

<p>
What he had heard was enough to make
him fear the worst.  Her refusal to listen to
Marmaduke, and her offer of a purely sisterly
regard, although it assured him that at
present she was resolved not to forget her duty,
gave him no assurance that such prudence
would long continue.  Could she restrict
herself to that sisterly love?  Could she know
that one so young, so handsome, so imposing,
loved her, and not at last yield to his love?
</p>

<p>
He would snatch her from the danger by
taking her at once from London.  Away from
her lover, she might forget him, or he might
seek another.  It was necessary to take a
decided step.
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Vyner came into his study, he
at once assumed an unusual tone of
command, and informed her that it was his
pleasure they should at once return to the
country.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Meredith, what are you thinking
of?  The country!  We cannot leave town
in the height of the season."
</p>

<p>
"I have my reasons," he said, with as
much dignity as he could assume.
</p>

<p>
"And I have mine for not going."
</p>

<p>
"But I insist upon it."
</p>

<p>
She seated herself in one of the easy chairs,
and said, quietly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You will not insist when you have heard
me.  This very morning, Mr. Ashley has made
a foolish declaration of love to me."
</p>

<p>
He was thunderstruck.  The quiet matter-of-fact
style in which she communicated this
intelligence, was indeed a masterpiece of
adroitness.  There are moments in our lives
when audacity is prudence; and this was one,
when nothing but an audacious avowal could,
by anticipating, defeat the accusation she
knew he would bring forward.  She lost
nothing by avowing it, as she was certain he
already knew it; but, on the other hand, by
anticipating him, she was enabled to give
her own colouring to the appearances which
condemned her.
</p>

<p>
"I see your surprise," she added; "you
little expected it, nor did I.  You thought he
was attached to Violet; I thought so too; and
as I am sure Violet is attached to him, I have
set my mind upon the match.  But now, look
here: I received his declaration without anger
and without encouragement.  I told him I
would love him as a sister, and made him
promise, on pain of instantly refusing to see
him, to cease all such language, and to crush
all such hopes.  Did I act rightly?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;very&mdash;very."
</p>

<p>
"But, suppose I run away into the country,
what will he imagine?  That I am afraid of
him, afraid of myself; that I love him, and
avoid him.  Do you wish him to think <i>that</i>?
You do not.  Then we remain."
</p>

<p>
"But ... and you ... will you continue
to see him?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  If I am to avoid him let it be
done at once.  If not, let us treat him as if
he had never made that silly declaration.
He will soon get over this.  It is only a
passing fancy.  He saw me a mere girl, wedded
to one old enough to be my father, and
imagined, as all men would imagine, that I
should be easily persuaded to forget what was
due to my husband, and to myself.  I have
undeceived him.  My coldness and firmness
will soon cure him.  He will then think of
Violet."
</p>

<p>
She ceased.  He took vast pinches of snuff
in an agitated absent manner, but made no
remark.  She perceived that she had gained
the day, and left him to his reflections.
</p>

<p>
Bitter enough those reflections were.  The
explicit avowal had staggered him&mdash;had taken
from him the very weapon he was to use; but
it had in no way alleviated his jealous anguish.
He could not answer her&mdash;yet could not satisfy
himself.  The reference she had made to his
age still rung in his ears, and told him plainly
that his rival would one day be happy.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon Violet and Rose returned.
He received them with unwonted tenderness,
for his heart ever yearned to those whom he
had excluded from it, and he felt bitter remorse
for having sacrificed them to his wife.  Violet
was peculiarly dear to him at this moment.
He felt for her misplaced attachment, and
remembered how ill she had been treated at
home.  He folded her to his breast, with a
lovingness which brought the tears into her
eyes, and as she sat down on his knee, one
arm around his neck, delighted with this
change in his manner, she divined at once
the real cause of the change.  As it was
Mrs. Vyner who had estranged him from her, so
must it be Mrs. Vyner who had brought back
his love.
</p>

<p>
It was a touching sight to see this parent
and child united by a common sorrow, mutually
pitying and mutually comforting each other,
having in one embrace forgotten all that had
once been distrust and coldness, and now
possessed by that overflowing love which, in
its exaggeration, desires to atone for past
coldness.
</p>

<p>
It was not what they said; for few words
passed between them; it was their eloquent
looks, significant pressure of hands, convulsive
embraces, and tones pregnant with meaning.
The father mutely demanded forgiveness, and
the child demanded a continuance of love.
</p>

<p>
After an hour of this intense emotion they
grew calmer, and began to talk of indifferent
things.  From time to time they hovered about
the name of Marmaduke, and betrayed, in
their very recurrence to the subject, and
hesitation in speaking openly of it, how predominant
it was in their minds.  At last they ventured
on the name.  It is impossible to convey an
idea of the conversation which ensued, because
it was conducted in phrases of the most
guarded vagueness, but made full of meaning
by the looks which accompanied them.  Slowly,
but irresistibly, the conviction came upon her,
that her father had discovered his wife's guilty
passion; or, at least, <i>suspected</i> it.  Her object,
therefore, was, if possible, to persuade him that
Marmaduke came there for herself; and she
even went so far as to laugh faintly at his
efforts to make himself agreeable to Mrs. Vyner,
by way of using a stepmother's
influence in his favour.
</p>

<p>
Her voice shook, as she uttered this heroic
falsehood.
</p>

<p>
He gazed at her with mournfulness; a tear
rolled down his cheek; his heart swelled as he
sobbed out,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My poor child! my poor child!"
</p>

<p>
He dared not undeceive her, dared not tell
her what he knew.
</p>

<p>
She saw that she was not believed, but little
did she know the mournful pity with which her
supposed credulity filled him.
</p>

<p>
It was a relief to her when the dinner-bell
rang, and put an end to their interview.
</p>

<p>
He saw her depart, and sat sighing deeply,
wholly bewildered at the inextricable difficulties
of his position; and when Mrs. Vyner
came in, and chatted away about the opera, to
which they were going that night, as if nothing
whatever had occurred, he almost felt as if he
had just awakened from a dream-troubled
sleep.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was an appalling struggle in Marmaduke's
breast that day as he reached home.
The terrible scene which had passed between
him and Mrs. Vyner, with its plainly expressed
hint at assassination, made him shudder as he
again and again went over it in memory.
False and heartless he had known her; but
for <i>this</i> he had not been prepared.  And he
felt a sort of sickness come over him as he
reflected on the peril which he had escaped,
in Vyner's not coming to listen at the very
moment when she had proposed, and he had
affected to accept the proposition!  He would
then have been accused of having really meant
to perpetrate the crime; for who would have
credited his disavowal? who would have
credited his assurance that he was but
feigning what his soul abhorred?
</p>

<p>
By a retrospective glance at his own conduct,
and at the peril he had escaped, he was
led to meditate on the nature of this woman;
and by a reflection on her criminal thoughts,
he was shown the criminality of his own.
</p>

<p>
This revenge which he had planned so
remorselessly, what was it but a crime?  If he had
been wronged by a heartless woman, was it
for him thus to measure out the punishment? and
did her jilting him deserve so terrible a
retribution?
</p>

<p>
After all, was not vengeance a "wild
justice," but only the justice of savages?  Was
it worthy of civilized, christianized man?  And
for a man to wreak it on a woman, was not
that petty, ignoble, more like spite than
retribution?
</p>

<p>
Such were the thoughts which possessed
him.  That they never suggested themselves
before, arises from the fact of his never having
before been cool enough to question the
legitimacy of his feelings.  But now they
staggered him; now they came upon him like
a remorse; and he <i>relinquished his scheme of
vengeance</i>!
</p>

<p>
The next day, impelled by some strange
impulse which he could not explain, he went to
the Vyners.  Violet observed the agitation of
his manner, and attributed it to meeting her
again, after what had evidently transpired
during her absence.  She was, therefore,
considerably surprised when he begged for a few
moments' private conversation with her, at the
same time entreating Rose to leave them
alone.  She had intended to refuse the
request, but Rose had departed before she could
open her lips.  Rose too well understood the
purport of that interview, not to be anxious
to forward it by her absence.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ashley," said Violet, coldly, "there is
no subject upon which I can hear you alone;
you will oblige me, therefore, by suffering me
to follow my sister."
</p>

<p>
"Violet!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ashley, by whose authority do you
address me in that manner?"
</p>

<p>
"The authority of my love.  Violet, I love
you ... you know it ... but I must tell you
so ... I must..."
</p>

<p>
She moved towards the door; he intercepted
her, and put his back against it.  Drawing
herself up to her full height, with a haughty
gesture she motioned him to let her pass.
</p>

<p>
"I did not expect <i>this</i>," he said, without
moving; "I thought I should, at least, be
heard.  Miss Vyner had given me reason to
hope that she would at least suffer me to tell
her....  Violet, I cannot control myself.
You <i>must</i> know, you must long have
known I loved you, you must have seen it in
every...."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ashley I request to be allowed to leave
the room."
</p>

<p>
"Do you refuse to listen to me?"
</p>

<p>
"I do."
</p>

<p>
He stared at her bewildered; there was
something so calm and collected in her
manner, yet the manner was so incomprehensible,
that he was speechless for a few
moments.
</p>

<p>
"You cannot ... cannot have mistaken ... for
so many months ... do you mean that you
mistook my looks ... my words ... my
actions? ... Did you?"
</p>

<p>
"I did not."
</p>

<p>
"Good God! have you then been playing
with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Playing!" she repeated scornfully, yet
sadly.  "I play!"
</p>

<p>
"Then what can all this mean?  There is
some delusion ... a word may set it right....
You knew I loved you&mdash;did you not?  You
hear it now.  Violet, I love you&mdash;love you
as man never loved before.  Will you accept
that love?"
</p>

<p>
"Dare you ask me?" she said, fixing
her large eyes on his with searching keenness.
</p>

<p>
"Violet ... what is it that you doubt?"
</p>

<p>
"Your purpose."
</p>

<p>
"My purpose is, to tell you that my heart is
yours....  That I live but in the hope of
calling you mine."
</p>

<p>
Her bosom heaved&mdash;her nostrils dilated, and
with flashing eyes she proudly, almost fiercely,
exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Let me pass!"
</p>

<p>
"What <i>is</i> the meaning of this?"
</p>

<p>
"Let me pass, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Violet! are you mad, or do you think me
so?  Is my love an insult, that...."
</p>

<p>
"It <i>is</i> an insult&mdash;a deep insult.  Now, sir,
will you let me pass?"
</p>

<p>
"I <i>will</i> know what is at the bottom of all
this.  You may reject me, but you <i>shall</i>
explain.  It is so utterly inconceivable that,
after the encouragement you have given me,
you should pretend to regard my avowal as an
insult, that I demand an explanation."
</p>

<p>
In spite of the rising passion in his breast,
he uttered this so collectedly and so
earnestly, that Violet was somewhat perplexed,
and began almost to doubt her own conclusions.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ashley," she said, "a short while
ago, such an avowal could only have been felt
by me as an honour; but since that, your own
conscience will tell you why I reject, and reject
with deep scorn, the offer of your hand.  Pray
let me say no more."
</p>

<p>
His conscience did tell him, at least it
suggested what the cause most probably
was; but wishing to come to an explanation,
he said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My conscience tells me that I love you&mdash;only
you; will you tell me wherein lies the
insult?"
</p>

<p>
A long struggle ensued in her mind; she
could not give him the explanation he demanded,
because unable to bring herself to mention her
stepmother.
</p>

<p>
"If you persist," she said at last, "I must
persist also.  I tell you again, the offer of your
love to me&mdash;here, in this house, is an outrage,
and scorn is my only answer.  Does that
suffice?  Would you have me add more
bitterness to my refusal?"
</p>

<p>
"Violet, I cannot quit you without.....
Tell me, is there not <i>that</i> in your mind which
you shrink from uttering, and which has
reference to <i>some one</i> in this house?"
</p>

<p>
"You understand me, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I do."
</p>

<p>
"Then let me pass at once."
</p>

<p>
"Not until you have heard me.  Will you
hear me....  Will you, in this solemn
moment, let me lay before you the whole history
of my heart?  You think me a villain, will you
listen before you condemn?"
</p>

<p>
"I know not what plausible excuses..."
</p>

<p>
"Truth&mdash;the simplest truth shall be my
defence.  If that condemns me, I will submit in
patience.  Will you hear me?"
</p>

<p>
There was something so solemn and so
touching in his tone, that Violet was deeply
affected by it; the sad earnestness of his voice
pleaded eloquently in his favour.
</p>

<p>
He approached, and took her hand; she
withdrew it hastily, and moved towards the
mantelpiece, against which she leaned in an
attitude of exquisite dignity, turning her face
towards him, prepared to listen.  After gazing
stedfastly at her for a few seconds, while he
collected his thoughts, he thus spoke,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Violet, I am about to make a most painful
avowal; one that will startle you; one that
will seem wholly inexplicable.  When but a
boy, I loved&mdash;loved as boys love, unreasoningly
and ardently.  I have tropical blood in my
veins, Violet, and all passions become intense
with me.  The girl I loved returned my
affection.  We were to have been married.  I
was called away from England.  I returned to
my father in Brazil.  My father gave his
consent to our marriage.  I wrote to inform her of
it: she was overjoyed.  Her letters were as
ardent as even I could wish.  Suddenly they
ceased.  My father died.  I was settling his
affairs, and preparing to quit Brazil for
England, when I learned from a newspaper
that my affianced wife had married another."
</p>

<p>
He paused: a choking sensation in his
throat impeded utterance.  Violet had listened
eagerly, and still kept her eyes fixed upon
him.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot tell you," he resumed, "what I
suffered on awakening from the sort of stupor
in which this intelligence threw me.  You
have never known&mdash;may God preserve you
from ever knowing it!&mdash;what that desolation
is, when those we love are found unworthy of
our love!  The anguish and despair which
then tore my soul to pieces, I shudder to look
back upon.  It was not that my love had been
destroyed&mdash;it was not that which made the
pang; it was the horrible, heartless cruelty
with which I had been deceived.  I had been
sacrificed to wealth.  That I might have
forgiven; but it was done so cruelly!  Until she
had accepted her husband, her letters were as
affectionate and hopeful as ever.  The blow
was unbroken in its fall&mdash;no wonder that it
nearly crushed me!"
</p>

<p>
He paused again; and saw tears glisten in
the earnest eyes of his listener.  She, too, had
known what it was to suffer from hopeless
love!
</p>

<p>
"Violet, I am fierce and brutal in my
instincts, and my education had been but
indifferent&mdash;on one point especially it had
been deficient;&mdash;in the Christian spirit of
forgiveness.  Vengeance&mdash;the justice of the
savage&mdash;was what I had never learned to
disown.  Writhing under the torture which had
been inflicted, I took comfort solely in the
hope of vengeance.  I came to England with
that one absorbing object.  Now comes the
painful part of iny disclosure&mdash;if indeed you
have not already guessed it&mdash;the girl who had
... in a word, it was Mrs. Vyner!"
</p>

<p>
He expected to see her vehemently startled,
but she only whispered, in a hoarse and broken
voice,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I knew it."
</p>

<p>
"You knew it!  Then have you understood me?"
</p>

<p>
"Not quite."
</p>

<p>
"I must explain, then, my conduct further.
I was here in England, resolved on reparation
of the wrong I had suffered.  I knew not
what shape my vengeance would take, but I
was resolved to have it in some shape or other.
I saw you.  To know you, was to love you&mdash;and
I loved.  In my love, I forgot my misery,
and ceased to think of revenge.  You were
sometimes cold and haughty to me, Violet;
sometimes kind and encouraging.  Do you
remember when we rode to the sands that
afternoon, and sat upon the rock together
listening to the sea?  I could have told you
then how much I loved you, had not your
coldness chilled me.  Well, on that very day,
while I was suffering from your indifference;
<i>she</i>, jealous of you, chose to recall me back
again to my schemes, by pretending that her
marriage had been an act of jealous despair;
she roused the demon in me by her infernal
arts, and once more I resolved to wreak upon
her the vengeance you had made me forget.
From that moment I have pursued a scheme
which involved her ruin.  Many times have
I been vacillating, many times has a kind
word or look from you brought me back again
to a purer atmosphere; but <i>the devil would
have it!</i> and a haughty gesture from you has
thrown me back again.  Hurried onwards by
the irresistible course of events, I was nearly
losing myself for ever, when last night I had
my eyes opened.  I saw that the only
vengeance worthy of a man was <i>contempt</i>.  At
once, I resolved to cease feigning love for the
miserable being whom I had marked as my
victim; resolved to break away from the
net in which I was entangled, by quitting
England.
</p>

<p>
"Before I left England, I had only to learn my
fate: if you refused me, I should carry my
despair into distant lands; if you accepted the
offer of a heart, I thought you would not
refuse to quit England with me.  You have
now heard all.  I have told you of my crime:
if repentance will not clear me from the
stain...."
</p>

<p>
The door was thrown violently open before
he could conclude the sentence, and Mrs. Vyner
stood before them.
</p>

<p>
They started as at an apparition.
</p>

<p>
Fearful indeed was the aspect of the little
fury, as with bloodshot eyes, quivering lips,
and spasm-contracted face, she trembled
before them.  All that was diabolical in her
nature seemed roused, and looking from her
eyes: passion made her hideous.
</p>

<p>
"Your little history is incomplete," she
said in a hissing tone; her voice lowered by
the intensity of her feeling; "there is a
chapter to be added, which you will allow me to
add.  Miss Vyner is so excellent a listener
that she will not refuse to hear it."
</p>

<p>
Violet looked haughtily down upon her, and
said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I desire to hear no more."
</p>

<p>
"But you must hear this; it concerns you.
You cannot be indifferent to anything which
relates to your honourable lover; you cannot
be unwilling to know that he who offers you
his hand is vain fool enough to be the dupe
of any woman, as he has been <i>mine</i>.  He has
told you, and how prettily he told it! what
pathos! what romance! he told you how I
played with him.  That is true.  He was such
a vain silly creature that no one could resist
the temptation.  Not only did I make a fool
of him as a girl.  I have done so as a married
woman.  I persuaded him that even respect
for my husband, respect for the world could
not withstand the all-conquering beauty of
his lumpish person, and he believed
it! believed that his face was a charm no woman
could resist.  This besotted vanity brought
him to my feet; yes, even at the time
you were sighing for him, he was at my
feet, ardent, submissive, a plaything for my
caprice!"
</p>

<p>
She saw Violet writhing, and her savage
heart exulted in the pain she was inflicting;
she saw Marmaduke's calm contempt, and her
exasperation deepened at the unavailingness
of her sarcasms to wound him.
</p>

<p>
Turning from her, as from one unworthy of
notice, he said to Violet,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I repeat, my fate is in your hands.  I love
you, love you as I never loved before&mdash;with my
whole soul: love you with deep reverence for
all that is so great and noble in you, and to
that generous and exalted mind I leave my
errors to be judged."
</p>

<p>
The sarcasm implied in this avowal almost
maddened Mrs. Vyner.
</p>

<p>
"Accept him, Miss Vyner," she said with
a short, hollow, and hysterical laugh; "pray
put him out of his misery; accept the offering
of his deep reverence, for that offering is <i>my
leavings</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke and Violet both started as this
poisoned sarcasm, issued from her lips, and
their faces told her plainly she had struck
deep.
</p>

<p>
"A reformed rake, you know, makes the
best husband," she pursued; "so that one so
inflammable as <i>he</i> is, will be sure to make a
constant and adoring husband.  You will be
so happy with him!  Whenever conversation
grows dull, he can amuse you with narrating
little episodes of his love for me, and my
<i>cruelty</i> that will be so pleasant! you will
never tire of that!  Accept him: you will be
sure never to repent it!"
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke could have strangled her.
</p>

<p>
Violet, seeing clearly the purpose of these
horrible phrases, cut them short by saying,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ashley, on some better occasion we
will speak again of this; do not let the present
ignoble scene continue."
</p>

<p>
She held out her hand to him.  He pressed
it to his lips.  Mrs. Vyner nearly shrieked
with mad jealousy; but suppressed the
explosion of her agony; while Violet swept out of
the room, disdaining to give even a passing
glance at her.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Vyner sank exhausted into a chair.
Her brain was as if on fire, and her whole
frame shook violently with the unutterable
rage, jealousy, and hate which stormed within
her heart.
</p>

<p>
Marmaduke could not in his fiercest moments
have desired a more terrible retribution
than that which now had fallen on the
miserable woman; and he gazed upon her with
a pity which astonished himself.  To this he
had brought her; unwittingly it is true,
but he felt it was he who had moved the
stone which had fallen and crushed her;
and now that she lay there suffering before
him, his anger had gone, and pity filled its
place.
</p>

<p>
She expected him to speak; she saw his
fixed gaze and endeavoured to interpret it; but
he spoke not.  Before she was aware of his
intention, he had left the room.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes afterwards, Meredith Vyner
found her apparently lifeless on the floor: she
had swooned.
